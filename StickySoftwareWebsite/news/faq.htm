        face="Arial">A. Oh, you know, just some brain cells
        somewhere.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Why Sticky?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Sticky was the name of a band
        (don't ask, you don't want to<br>
        hear anything) and then came the Web site. Once the
        handheld<br>
        PC came along, wow: we just had to develop for it. So we<br>
        taught ourselves Visual C++ and the rest is history.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How come your software
        is free?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Not all of it is! Pocket
        Universe is a commercial product, which<br>
        can be bought from the </font><a
        href="http://www.palm-size-pc.com/software.html"
        target="_blank"><font face="Arial"><strong>Palmsize PC
        Store</strong></font></a><font face="Arial"><strong>,</strong>
        as can FlipperPro.<strong><br>
        </strong>Pocket Universe took over a year to develop, and
        we think the price<br>
        is very low considering that many PsPC games cost even
        more!. <br>
        Also, it's an amazing program and we would like some
        reward for our hard <br>
        work: mostly so we can buy a nice Meade LX200. And a
        Honda Fireblade.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">TankZone is not free. It's
        charity-ware. We're serious: if you use it,<br>
        make a donation.It's the least you can do.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Other software is free because
        frankly it's not worth our while trying<br>
        to collect payment for it. If we tried to charge, say,
        five dollars for<br>
        HangMan, then we would probably lose out on each copy we
        sold. <br>
        And people would complain that it didn't interface
        directly with the<br>
        Project Gutenberg site.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to send us money however, don't let that stop
        you. <br>
        Send email to </font><a
        href="mailto:iwantyoutohaveanewtelescope@sticky.net"><font
        face="Arial">iwantyoutohaveanewtelescope@sticky.</font></a><font
        face="Arial">co.uk and <br>
        we'll gladly give you our bank details. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Aren't you worried that
        giving away software for free will <br>
        devalue software development as a whole?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Um. No. More worried about not
        getting enough exercise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How come I don't see
        your software on any of the usual <br>
        Windows CE sites?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Sticky Software currently does
        not agree with Web sites which <br>
        provide links directly to EXE or ZIP files, or who store
        files locally <br>
        on their own web site. Some sites even demand you
        &quot;register&quot; with<br>
        them to download other people's free software! Madness!<br>
        Other reasons include:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">1. We want to you visit our web
        site for yourself. That way you can<br>
        check up the background information on the software, read
        the<br>
        updated support and FAQ news and also find out about the
        other<br>
        programs we have available. If you simply click a link
        and<br>
        download the software, you are very unlikely to visit
        this site.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">2. If another Web site stores our
        software, we have no control. We<br>
        cannot ensure that you are using the latest version. If
        you download<br>
        it from here, you know it's the most current version
        available.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">3. To help us plan, we need to know
        which programs are the most<br>
        popular. We can only tell this if the software is
        downloaded from <br>
        our site. We do not use Cookies, or store the names or
        details of<br>
        anyone who visits this site -- but we can tell how many
        downloads<br>
        were made.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">4. Some software can ONLY be
        downloaded and installed from a<br>
        particular location, due to the way it works. This isn't
        our doing, it's<br>
        the way Mobile Channels work. Sadly, some large web
        directories<br>
        are so short-sighted that they cannot appreciate this
        fact. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">So if you don't see TankZone (say)
        on CE Monster, then you know<br>
        the Website in question has decided that it knows best
        for you and<br>
        has refused to provide a link to Sticky Software. We
        think this sucks,<br>
        but hey, if you're reading this you got here. We hope you
        find<br>
        something of interest.</font></p>
