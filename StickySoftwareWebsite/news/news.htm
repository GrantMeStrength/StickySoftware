        to know where the sun is going to be on certain dates<br>
        in the future to help plan their shooting schedules. <br>
        Pocket Universe is ideal for this, as it can tell you <br>
        the exact location of the sun (and let you see it <br>
        on-screen), for any date in the future and for any<br>
