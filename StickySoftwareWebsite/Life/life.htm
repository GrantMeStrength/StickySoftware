        To download Pocket Life, select one of the versions
        below. You'll need<br>
        to know which processor your HPC uses. The file you
        download will be<br>
        a ZIP archive. Unzip this on your desktop PC, and copy
        the files over<br>
        to the HPC. They don't need to be stored in any
        particular location.The<br>
        files consist of the program, and a directory full of
        example lifeforms.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial">This program makes use of the
        WinCEv1 MFC libraries. You must have a file <br>
        called MFCWCE.DLL present in the Windows/ directory on
        your HPC for<br>
        the program to work. Some HPCs have this file included in
        ROM, others<br>
        require you to install it. </font></p>

        face="Arial"><img src="lifebuttons.GIF" width="472"
        height="383"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What do I need to run Life?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. An HPC, with WindowsCE. This
        program was written on a Velo1, under <br>
        WindowsCEv1. I've been told that it works on other HPC
        devices, but I haven't <br>
        had the opportunity to test that myself. The program
        should run under WindowsCE v2,<br>
        again I haven't been able to test this. Obviously I'm as
        keen as everyone else to get <br>
        hold of WinCEv2. If you have a WinCEv2 machine, then
        installing the original<br>
        MFCWCE.DLL file might mean the program will work.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. There is a large blank
        portion of screen!</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. There should be, if your
        HPC&nbsp;has more than 480 pixels across. My HPC<br>
        has 480, and so I cannot test software which has a larger
        screen.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Do I have the latest version?
        </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A You do if you have version v1.3
        (look in the Help box). This version adds new features <br>
        to v1.1 If you have older versions, please delete them.
        I've discovered a bug in these which <br>
        could potentially crash your HPC.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. I get an error message when I
        try to run it!</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. If you get an error message when
        you try to run the program, this is most likely due to <br>
        you not having the MFC library file stored on your HPC.
        This is a file containing common <br>
        functions, and is required by applications written in a
        particular way. You may already have <br>
        this library depending on your HPC (the HP device has it
        in ROM) or if have already installed <br>
        a program which includes the library. If you don&#146;t
        have these files, you will have to download them. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What is Life anyway?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Life is a cross between a
        computer game and a simulation. The screen displays
        consists of a <br>
        grid where &quot;cells&quot; can exist. You can place
        cells anywhere on the grid by clicking with the pen. <br>
        Once the cells are placed on the grid, you can see what
        happens in the next generation: <br>
        click &quot;&gt;&quot; or select &quot;Go Once&quot; from
        the menu. Cells live or die depending on two rules:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">1. If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbours,
        everything is fine and it survives. Any more than three
        and it <br>
        starves to death, less than two and it dies of loneliness</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">2. If an empty square has three
        cells around it, a new cell will be born.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">These rules are applied to every
        square in the grid for each generation. If you wish, you
        can <br>
        click on &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; or select &quot;Start&quot;
        from the menu, and successive generations will be
        calculated <br>
        automatically. This will continue until all the cells are
        dead or you select &quot;Stop&quot;. The speed <br>
        of the generations is controlled in the &quot;Speed&quot;
        menu, and there are three settings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. So, this is interesting is
        it?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, because certain patterns
        produce very interesting results. You can set the speed <br>
        to &quot;fast&quot;, click &quot;start&quot; and watch as
        the screen fills with a swarm of cells. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Are you going to release an
        update?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. No. This program has now
        finished development for the present.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Is this program Public
        Domain?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. No. It's not, it's copyright.
        However you have permission to use it for free (although
        if <br>
        you wish to send a Shareware donation that's fine).
        Please don't store<br>
        it on a Web site -- if you want other people to use it,
        please point them to the Sticky Net<br>
        website instead. Thanks.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Do you know of any other
        links to Life on the Web?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, loads. Any of these links
        will bring you to pages created by people who really, <br>
        really dig the Life program. You'll also find versions of
        Life for your desktop machine <br>
        (which all have huge grids) and you find discussions on
        glider guns, spaceships and all <br>
        sorts of other things, such as modelling real world
        problems using Cellular Automata. <br>
        You'll also find plenty of little shapes to try in your
        copy of Pocket Life.</font></p>
