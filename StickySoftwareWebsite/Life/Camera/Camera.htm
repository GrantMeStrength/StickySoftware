<P><IMG SRC="../soft5.GIF" HEIGHT=48 WIDTH=48 ALIGN=LEFT>Take your HPC
with you, and your digital camera suddenly<BR>
becomes a lot more powerful. Now you can use your HPC to back<BR>
up important images, or even send them by fax or email. Imagine<BR>
sending back your holiday snaps while you are still on the beach!<BR>
<BR>
CamLink currently supports the Kodak DC20 and DC25 cameras.<BR>
Although these cameras are no longer manufactured by Kodak,<BR>
they can still be found. They are cheap, offer reasonable performance,<BR>
and are ideal for use &quot;in the field&quot;. DC20 owners like to strap
their<BR>
cameras to model airplanes and rockets, or use them as Webcams.<BR>
<BR>
Combining them with a HPC opens up all kinds of new facilities.<BR>
Please note: this software uses a serial link with the camera. You<BR>
will need to sort out a lead yourself between the HPC and the camera:<BR>
it can be done using the existing leads, a null modem cable and <BR>
various gender changers.<BR>
<BR>
Before you ask, yes: we would like to support other Digital cameras.<BR>
If you have a favourite camera let us know, and let the camera <BR>
manufacturer know too!<BR>
