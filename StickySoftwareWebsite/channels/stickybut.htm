<p><font face="Arial"><em>A Palmsize PC utility which makes it
easier than ever to get started!</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If, like us, you came to the Palmsize PC by
way of the Palm Pilot or Palm III from 3com, you might be missing
the rather useful buttons on the &quot;desktop&quot;. The Start
menu is the obvious Windows-style method to launch applications,
but it can be a hassle. The Palmsize PC's own user-defined
buttons make it easy to launch four applications, and there are
various third party floating launch-pads which also simplify
things slightly.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">None of these solutions comes close to
Sticky Buttons for ease of use. Sticky Buttons put the icons to
launch your favourite applications right there on the desktop.
One tap, you've launched the Notepad, Calculator or other
programs which you get to choose. The buttons are on the desktop
as a Mobile Component, so they are always ready when you switch
on. They don't live on a separate window or dialog box, they are
part of the standard desktop. With this flexibility you also get
to control their location on the desktop, or even turn them off
when you don't need them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Sticky Switch is a combination of a Mobile
Component and a standard Windows CE application. The Mobile
Component looks after displaying the icons on the screen, and the
application allows you to select which icons you want to appear,
including the Windows CE logo. In a nutshell, here's what you can
display on your desktop as a launch button:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>* Any of the following key
applications: Contacts, Calculator, Calendar, Notetaker, Inbox,
Channels, Tasks, Voice notes. Each has the associated icon
built-in.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>* Up to four applications
of your chosing. You get to select the Shortcut file to display,
and Sticky Buttons adds its own default icon. You can change this
icon if you want.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Installing Sticky Buttons is a
two-part process. First of all, you need to install the Mobile
Component. Then you need to purchase the Sticky Buttons Control
program from The Palm-size PC Store, which will be available
shortly. To give you an idea of how the program works, you can
use the Mobile Component for free to launch three default
applications: Tasks, Calendar and Tasks. To launch all eight key
applications, or add your own to the list, you must purchase the
Sticky Buttons Control program.</font></p>
