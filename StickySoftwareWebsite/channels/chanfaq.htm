FAQ</font></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What is a Active Desktop
Component?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. An Active Desktop Component is a special
type of Mobile Channel, providing a control which can be located
on your Palmsize PC's Active Desktop. Examples are the Logo and
Tasks reminder displays which appear on your Palmsize PC's
desktop. They can be repositioned and resized, and can you select
which to view from the Settings/Display dialog.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I use it on a Handheld PC?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No, it's for the Palmsize PC only. The
Handheld PCs don't have an Active Desktop. Mobile Channels and
Active Desktop Components are two entirely separate things.
Although it's possible to display Mobile Channels on a handheld
computer, it's not possible to display an Active Desktop
Component on anything other than a Palmsize PC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How do I install it?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. You download it like any other Mobile
Channel: that is, you use Internet Explorer 4 or better and click
on the link. Only the Microsoft web browser supports the
downloading the synchronisation of the Active Channel data. IE4
will download the channel, and the next time you synchronise your
Palmsize PC it will installed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I use Netscape or Opera? Why
must I use IE4?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. You must use IE4 (or better) because
only IE4 includes the necessary code to subscribe to channels, to
download their contents and and allow them to appear on the
screen of the Palmsize PC after synchronisation. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I store Mobile Components in
Compact Flash memory?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Not at this time. Or at least, it's not
something we've tried. While it is possible to hack the registry
to force Channels into CF memory, this is probably just asking
for trouble.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. OK, I installed the Mobile
Component, what next?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Open up the Display Properties dialog
and select it. You can alter its position on the screen in
relation to the other components using the Move Up and Down
buttons. A component which isn't ticked won't appear on the
desktop.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. When I downloaded a Component to
Internet Explorer 4, I see an error message. What gives?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. When the channel downloads, there may be
an error displayed in the IE window: it's safe to ignore this
error, as it is usually caused by IE4 itself trying to execute
the Palmsize PC mobile component, which of course won't succeed.
Some systems are apparently set-up to deal with CDF files rather
than letting IE4 process them: check this if you are having
problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. When I click on the Active
Desktop Component from inside Internet Explorer, I see a GPF!
What's happening?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. There seems to be a bug somewhere in the
IE4 / Mobile Channels/ Active Desktop Component / CDF file
process which causes IE4 to crash. This is irritating, and we
have yet to find a definitive reason for it. If you know, please
tell us! In the meantime, if you experience this problem here is
a workaround. Click on the Mobile Component, and let IE4 crash.
Before IE4 bites the dust, it will download the component and all
the necessary data. <em>In fact, it seems that IE4 then tries to
execute the CDF and finding that it makes no sense (it's not a
palmsize PC) it crashes</em>. Re-start IE4, and open up the
Channel panel. Right click on the component and select Refresh,
to make sure it has downloaded all the information and is ready
to copy it to the Palmsize PC. You should be able to perform the
sync process and carry on as normal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. When I performed a
synchronisation, nothing was copied across. What did I do wrong?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Make sure that you have selected
Channels as one of the items of information to be synchronised:
it isn't the default setting. This is done on the desktop in the
ActiveSync Options dialog.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="BigTime3.gif" width="300"
height="312"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I synchronised the Active
Desktop Component, but on the desktop display there are no
graphics, just outlined boxes.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Ensure that you haven't switched off the
&quot;accept pictures and images&quot; setting on the Palmsize
PC. Open Channels, tap View/Options and switch on the pictures
and images options. Also make sure you have enough memory free.
It's also possible there is an error in the Moble Component, so
make sure you have the latest version. Contact us if still have
problems.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How can I update Active Desktop
Components?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. The clever thing about components is
that they can be very easily updated. This allows the provider to
correct mistakes, add new graphics or features and it's all done
almost automatically. All you need to do is start up Internet
Explorer on your desktop, and view the Channel bar. Right click
on the Active Desktop Component you want to update and select
&quot;Update Now&quot;. If your computer is connected to the
internet, it will download the component ready for
synchronisation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How can I remove components I
don't need any more?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Good question. You can unsubscribe from
a channel, and remove it from the Channels list, but it appears
that information will linger on in the Palmsize PC's memory.
Microsoft recommend you subscribe to another channel before
deleting the first, but there are still sometimes problems.
Essentially every Mobile Component has a CDF file, which lives in
the Windows/Temporary Internet Files folder. Find and delete this
file if you don't need it. Some Components also have an MCS file,
which can also be deleted. However, yet other components will
store other files -- such as graphical images -- and you will
also need to remove these. Even then, the Channel name can linger
in the Settings/Display dialog, as information is retained in the
Registry. This takes up minimal space, so it can be ignored,
although a cold boot is needed to flush them out totally.
However, we're working on a free utility to remove unwanted
channels. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Isn't a bit rubbish giving away
software which can't be properly uninstalled?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Well, yes, sorta. But it's really not
our fault -- there is no built-in method for removing everything
associated with a Mobile Component, and there is no documentation
available. However, if you purge the files from the
Windows/Temporary Internet Files folder you have removed the bulk
of any downloaded information. If you are paranoid about removing
it, you'll need to poke around in the Registry. Some files are
stored in the Windows CE internal database, so you'll need to
edit these too. For the few extra bytes you'll save, it's really
not worth the hassle. We'll get around to writing an un-installer
sometime.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. My computer seems to hang when I
perform a sychronisation when using Channels!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, ours too. The AutoSync system is
prone to several headaches from time to time, and there isn't a
great deal that can be done. Hate to say it, but it could
possible be a bug in the Microsoft software &lt;gasp&gt; as
others have reported problems with the 2.2 Services Update, and
apparently a fix is on the way. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Whoops! I deleted the Active
Desktop Components which comes with my Palmsize PC! Now what can
I do?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. The data for these components is stored
in the Windows directory. Copy them back to the Windows/Temporary
Internet Files folder and perform a warm boot. If that fails,
you'll have to perform a cold boot and completely reset your
handheld.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I edit the Active Desktop
Components to add my own information?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Oh yes, certainly. The Components
consist of two text files: the CDF file which contains a list of
the other scripts and any graphics, and the MCS file which
contains the scripting commands. This is a cross between HTML and
Visual BASIC: if you open up the file in Wordpad you should see
how it works. Information on writing scripts is on the Microsoft
Web Site. If you make any interesting changes, please mail them
in so we can share them.</font></p>
