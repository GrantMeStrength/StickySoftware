        color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Form over
        function?</strong><br>
        </font><p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The
        Nino has style, there's no doubt about it. Philips have<br>
        a exciting design department, not afraid to make their<br>
        products look different, and the Philip's Palmsize PC<br>
        has benefited.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The
        hardware specs are standard for the PsPC, with<br>
        a MIPS processor, 4Mb of memory, 320 by 240 four<br>
        grey-scale screen, and a stylus. The state of the modem<br>
        is open to question: it's possible that the European<br>
        models will use a soft-modem via a simple clip-in lead,<br>
        but as yet this has to be confirmed. Personally, I use<br>
        the IR port to communicate with an Ericsson SH888<br>
        mobile phone, so I'm totally spoilt.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Speed is
        good, and all the standard WindowsCE <br>
        applications included work perfectly well. 4Mb mightn't<br>
        seem a lot, but it's still enough for all the contacts,<br>
        tasks and appointments you are likely to need. If you<br>
        do intend to use a lot of third party software (and I<br>
        certainly hope you will!) a Compact Flash card makes a<br>
        great investment. I've fitted a 32Mb card snugly and<br>
        discretely in the slot on my Nino, and still have to hit<br>
        half full: and that is with four full novels, a lot of
        sampled<br>
        voice notes, and all the software I can get my hands on<br>
        installed. Yup, the 4Mb basic model suits me fine.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bundles
        of fun</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The
        bundled software is a welcome surprise with the Nino.<br>
        Unlike other systems, it comes built-into ROM, which<br>
        means you can enjoy the advantages of smART's voice<br>
        and hand writing recognition packages from the moment<br>
        you switch on. The T9 soft keyboard is also included,<br>
        although I have to admit I'm not a fan of this system.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Another
        pleasant surprise was the inclusion of a NiMH<br>
        battery pack as standard. No need to worry about your<br>
        batteries running out, even with the backlight on all the<br>
        time. As long as the Nino is returned to its lovely
        little<br>
        docking platform, it will recharge overnight and be ready<br>
        for action in the morning.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The
        carrying case for the Nino says Samonsite on it,<br>
        although it's leather-ette material and not solid plastic<br>
        designed in a wind tunnel, or designed to withstand<br>
        being run over in a truck. It will prevent scratches and<br>
        does allow access to the voice recording button. It's<br>
        also slightly bulky due to ridged edges, and you might<br>
        find it too large to fit into a pocket. I've risked
        carrying<br>
        it without the case, but will acquire some screen<br>
        protectors before making that a regular occurance. <br>
        Speaking of the screen, I've no complaints about it,<br>
        and that is sitting it side-by-side with the Casio E-10. <br>
        Both screens are extremely similar.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The Nino
        is definitely a well thought-out machine. Philips<br>
        have ensure that out of the box, it comes with everything<br>
        you need. Three hundred pounds is a lot of money, but<br>
        you are getting a lot of computer for your money. More
        and<br>
        more people are realising that Windows CE is much more<br>
        than a PIM (personal information manager) and the Nino is<br>
        an ideal machine to jump into the world of mobile
        computing.</font></p>
