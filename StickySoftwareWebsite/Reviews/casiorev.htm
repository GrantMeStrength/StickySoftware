        note: In the UK at least, the E-10 has been<br>
        replaced by the E-11. This is a functionally indentical<br>
        Palmsize PC, but with 8Mb instead of 4Mb and a <br>
        PSU included in the box. The price remains the<br>
        same, which could push it ahead of the Nino. Make<br>
        sure you see both before buying!</strong></em></font><p><font
        color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Small but
        perfectly formed?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Casio was
        the first out with a Palmsize PC, although not in<br>
        Europe where the Nino beat in into the shops. In fact,
        you <br>
        still might have to shop around a little to find an E-10<br>
        on sale in the UK. If you can get to Tottenham Court Road<br>
        your laughing, otherwise ring around a few dealers and be<br>
        prepared for mail order. This is a great shame, as the
        E-10<br>
        is one heck of a little machine.<br>
        <br>
        And it most definitely is little too: much smaller than
        the Nino, <br>
        and much closer to the Palm Pilot which used to grace
        this <br>
        very household. Part of the size is due to the use of AAA<br>
        rather than AA batteries. This makes a difference to<br>
        battery life of course, and there is a warning in the <br>
        instructions regarding the use of the backlight and sound<br>
        recorder. The first thing I did when the E-10 arrived was
        to<br>
        order a set of NiHM cells.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Tediously,
        no PSU is included as standard. If your PsPC<br>
        is going to spend a lot of time parked in its docking bay<br>
        and connected to your desktop PC, then a PSU is very<br>
        useful. It's hard to accept there isn't a PSU in the box:<br>
        I had to keep checking in case I'd missed it. But no,
        it's<br>
        an optional extra.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The E-10
        has a slightly different set of controls from the<br>
        Nino. Rather than a set of buttons on the side, the
        action,<br>
        up and down keys are in th form of a &quot;rocker&quot;
        switch. It's<br>
        easy to use, and slightly more intuative that bare
        buttons.<br>
        Right-handed people can easily use their thumb to control<br>
        it, Left-handies an index finger. Just above the rocker<br>
        switch is the voice record activation button. Of course,
        it's<br>
        just another user-definably button, but separating it
        from the<br>
        other three buttons on the front panel makes it a little
        more<br>
        special.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Different,
        by design</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Once you
        get over the slightly different controls and smaller<br>
        size, it's hard to tell the Nino and Cassiopeia apart.
        Except<br>
        that is when an intensive program such as Pocket
        Universe.<br>
        Although the E-10 also uses a MIPS processor, it's a<br>
        slightly different one from that in the Nino. To quote
        Casio,<br>
        <br>
        <em>&quot;..the on chip cache size is 8x that on the Nino
        so for <br>
        computationally intensive aps this would gain advantage. <br>
        Also the system board has been designed to take much <br>
        faster processors so minimised wait states.&quot;</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Sounds
        good, but it basically means it ran the astronomy<br>
        application just that little bit fastert. Very
        impressive.<br>
        The other Windows CE applications seemed to run at much<br>
        the same speed, if slightly nippier.. Another difference
        is the<br>
        inclusion of an earphone socket for listening to voice
        notes <br>
        without annoying your colleagues.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bundle</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Casio pop
        a CD of software for loading onto your E-10 into<br>
        the box, and the list includes bFax Express, a financial<br>
        calculator, a useful Find utility and a program for
        linking<br>
        with Casio digital cameras. Sadly the Tetris deal seems<br>
        to be over, as this isn't included.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The E-10
        has 4Mb of memory as standard. If you want to<br>
        use the Casio for PIM duties, this is more than enough.
        If<br>
        you want to install lots of third party software, then
        budget<br>
        for a CF card: even a small 4Mb card makes all the <br>
        difference.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">In the
        handheld PC market, size does matter: and the E-10<br>
        has that in its favour. It lack of PSU is annoying, and
        the<br>
        battery life is reduced -- although that's easily fixed
        with a<br>
        set of rechargables. Again, it's easy to fill that 4Mb,
        although<br>
        adding a CF card more than makes up for it. I'm actually<br>
        torn between the speed and size of the E-10, and the
        style <br>
        of the Nino. If Casio added rechargable batteries and a
        PSU,<br>
        then I'd probably pick it. It's cute!</font></p>
