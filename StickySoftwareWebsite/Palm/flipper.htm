<h2><a name="Introduction"><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">What are the two things Palmsize PC owners
want the most from their User Interface?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That's easy:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>1. A way to shut down open
applications. </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Microsoft's guidelines for the
Palmsize PC request that developers don't include any options to
close currently running applications. The idea is to let Windows
CE look after the memory management itself, leaving you to just
to get on with using the computer. If you are finished using the
Notetaker for example, you just start the next application and
Notetake with vanish into the background. If you need it again,
you launch it from the Start menu as before: and WindowsCE will
move it to the front of the display. </font><a
href="http://netnow.micron.net/~gilkman/"><font size="2"
face="Arial"><img src="flipper3.gif" align="right" border="0"
hspace="0" width="375" height="139"></font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">In theory this is a great idea. In
practice, many users don't feel <em>right</em> about it. We want
to shut down the programs we no longer need. We even go the
extent of opening the pop-up keyboard and entering CTRL and Q to
do it &quot;manually&quot;. We still want the control over our
programs which the Handheld PC and desktop versions of Windows
give us. We don't want to wait for WindowsCE to run out of memory
and shut down the applications: we want to do it ourselves!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>2. A way to </strong><em><strong>quickly</strong></em><strong>
return to frequently used applications. </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">As you normally don't or can't
shut down applications, the programs in the background are
wasted: they sit there sucking up resources. To get to them, you
have to open the Start menu and find and launch them again - what
a waste of time! How much better if you could just jump to them
with only a few taps on the screen. Quicker, easier, more logical
and more consistant with the Microsoft ideal of keeping the
applications open in the first place.</font></p>

<h2><a name="Features and benefits"><font face="Arial">Features
and benefits</font></a></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Flipper is a small program which
achieves both these much-needed tasks in one, unobtrusive taskbar
icon. Flipper is this easy to use:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Single-tap</strong> on the
icon, and the currently open tasks in the background are shuffled
around. Your current program (or desktop) flips to the
background, and a previous program flips to the foreground. Keep
single-tapping and all the open applications will appear, one
after the other.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Double-tap</strong> on the
icon, the currently open task (excluding the desktop) will be
closed. No fuss, no hunting for the Task Manager. One click, and
the current task is history. This is without a doubt, the easiest
way yet to keep your applications and tasks in check.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Tap-and-hold on the icon</strong>,
and you open a menu. The top items in the menu are the currently
running tasks. Select any of them to flip to that task
immediately.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="fd1.gif" width="300"
height="228"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">That's only half of what
FlipperPro can do. From the pop-up menu, you can quickly manage
your PsPC. Flip to other tasks, kill all other running programs,
open the hidden Windows CE Run... dialog. And we're still not
done yet!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="fd2.gif" width="377"
height="280"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now the fun really starts. Open
the Options Dialog, and you'll see a window like this. The colour
animated icons help you keep track of what's happening on your
system. Worried about power? or memory? Check the current values,
and jump straight to the revelant control panel setting windows.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="fd3.gif" width="440"
height="288"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are still <em>two</em> new
features to come:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Autokill</strong>. Active
this, and your PsPC will look after unused applications running
in the background. Don't worry about losing memory, or forgetting
to shut down programs. Relax, and let FlipperPro search for
unwanted applications every few minutes and close them down.
While this method of working mightn't suit everyone, it can be a
useful tool.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Startup Sound.</strong>
What everyone wants! Why not make your PsPC let you know you've
switched it on? If you have a CF installed, this option will
cause a sound-effect to be triggered when you power up your PDA.
Add amusing sound-effects! The option can be turned off when you
are running low on battery power, or when you have an alarm set.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Features at a glance:</strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Very easy to use Task Manager</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Kill unwanted applications with a
        unique double-tap</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Flip to a currently running program
        with one tap</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Very compact: less than 50K.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Control your PsPC with minimal screen
        taps = minmal effort</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Use a hardware button to switch apps</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Battery and Memory status</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Unique &quot;Startup Sound&quot;
        feature</font></li>

<h2><a name="Hints and Tips"><font face="Arial">Hints and Tips</font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Customise the sound!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you have a CF card on your PsPC, you can
make use of the Startup Sound option. This triggers a sound
everytime you switch on your PsPC. Don't stick with the supplied
sound -- use your imagination. Add your favourite sound effect by
copying a standard WAV file to the Windows/ directory on your
PsPC. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Keep it alive!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Make FlipperPro restart everytime you
perform a warm-restart. Copy the shortcut from the menu to the
directory Windows/Startup/ and it will be launched everytime the
PsPC reboots.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Button it</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Assign FlipperPro to one of the
user-definable buttons on the PsPC. When you press the button,
Flipper will flip to the next running application automatically.</font></p>

<h2><a name="FAQ"><font face="Arial"><strong>FAQ</strong></font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Am I entitled to a free upgrade?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. If you bought a previous version of
FlipperPro, then yes, you are. You should be receiving the
upgrade automatically from The Palmsize PC Store.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can FlipperPro work on a
handheld PC?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. It's not designed for the handheld PC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I have a new colour Palmsize PC
(Wyverne). Will it work?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, it's been tested on a Jornada 420.
The display has been improved to include colour.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How can I make the menu pop-up?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Tap on the flipper icon and hold:
previous versions of Flipper required a tap-slide-release motion
-- this is no longer used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I have the free demo. How can I
shut it down?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Tap on the taskbar near the icon, slide
over it, and release.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I can't hear my startup sound!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Make sure the option is turned on. This
feature only works if a CF (Compact Flash) card is present in
your system. If you have copied over your own file, make sure the
WAV file is compatible with your PsPC hardware: 8bit, 11kHz is a
good minimum. You cannot trigger MP3 files.</font></p>
