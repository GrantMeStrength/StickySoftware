<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Welcome to the easiest Task
Launching program, <em>ever</em>!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">People who've seen it ask &quot;Is
this the way Windows CE should have been?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">It's been a long time coming, but
it's been worth the wait. No other Windows CE task launcher works
in this way. Sticky Buttons actually places familiar buttons
right on the Active Desktop. No matter what other applications
you have installed, the icons will be there waiting to lauch the
key Windows CE applications (Notetaker, Voice Recorder, Inbox,
Calculator, Tasks, Channels, Contacts and Calendar) and up to
four applications of your choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Additionally, a logo file, the
date and a bar of essential utilities can be displayed: you
choose. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By default, Sticky Buttons
provides instant, one-tap access to all the key applications
built-into the Nino. Contacts, Calculator, Notetaker -- all just
one tap away. No need to open the Start menu: just tap, and
that's it. The user can select which of these icons to display,
and also assign up to four more for their own favourite programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Using Sticky Buttons is easy, as
the buttons are part of the Active Desktop. This means they can
be turned on or off from the standard Windows CE Display
properties window.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">FAQ</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. How is this different from other launch
programs?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. The key difference is that the launch
icons are displayed on the Active Desktop, not on a secondary
window. Tap on the desktop icon (in the bottom right of the
taskbar) and your launch icons are available.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. How large is the configuration program?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. The configuration program is between 140
and 180K in size. It can moved to a CF card if required, or even
deleted if you are happy with your button configuration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. What else does it do?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A.As well as completely changing the
appearance of your active desktop, and greating simplifying the
way in which you will use your Palmsize PC, Sticky Buttons also
has a bank of utility icons for power, battery and task
management.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. Can I choose which programs appear on
the desktop?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. You can select all, some or none of
the eight key Windows CE applications, and up to four of your own
favourite programs too. The icons for your own user-defined
programs are created from the programs themselves (note: except
on colour systems, where a default icon is used instead).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. Does it work in colour / monochrome?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, it works on both colour and
monochrome palmsize PCs. It's been tested on a Philips Nino 300,
Casio E-10, and Hewlett-Packard Jornada 420. The icons are colour
by default, and so look extra smart on colour systems. On
monochrome systems, the user-defined shortcut</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. Can I use my other graphics?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A, Yes! And we'll soon be providing some
free samples very soon for you to download. New logo files and
button images are easy to create and install.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. Can I mix the Active Desktop display
with other components?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, Sticky Buttons appears as a
standard desktop component, so you can switch on the other
components, alter the order and so on. You could elect to use
only the four user defined buttons for example, or only the
utilties, and have plenty of space for other components such as
appointments, tasks or a logo.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. How can I uninstall it completely?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. You can use the standard Remove Programs
utility. However, due to the way active desktop components are
inserted into the system, this will still leave a few files
lurking around. Follow this like to see how to purge your system
totally.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Q. Does it work on a handheld PC / handheld
PC Pro?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No, only Palmsize PCs. Bottom line: do
not buy this program if your Wndows CE computer has an integral
keyboard!</font></p>
