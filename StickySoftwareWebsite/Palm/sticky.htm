<h2><a name="Introduction"><font face="Arial"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></a></h2>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Welcome to the easiest Task
Launching program, </strong><em><strong>ever</strong></em><strong>!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">People who've seen it ask &quot;Is this the
way Windows CE should have been?&quot;. Upgraders from the Palm
Pilot sigh in relief. New users relax at the thought of not
having to use the Start menu. Heck, forget the stylus, you can
even poke the screen with your finger to launch your
applications. It's so easy and obvious, you'll wonder how you
ever did without it.<img src="sb.jpg" align="right" hspace="0"
width="200" height="261"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Now you have one-tap access to the programs
you need. No fumbling with the Start menu, just switch on, look
and tap. Why struggle with a menu system designed for desktop PCs
on your handheld? Revolutionise the way you use your Palmsize PC.
Sticky Buttons is fast, flexible and easy to customise to your
exact requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It's been a long time coming, but it's been
worth the wait. In production for over seven months,
well-respected Windows programming experts said it was
impossible: but Sticky Software knew it had to be done. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">No other Windows CE task launcher works in
this way. Sticky Buttons actually places familiar buttons right
on the Active Desktop. No matter what other applications you have
installed, the icons will be there waiting to lauch the key
Windows CE applications (Notetaker, Voice Recorder, Inbox,
Calculator, Tasks, Channels, Contacts and Calendar) and up to
four applications of your choice. What other task launcher
survive a warm reset as if nothing had happened?</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Additionally, a logo file, the date and a
bar of essential utilities can be displayed: you choose. Sticky
Buttons is a perfect companion to a dedicated task switching
program such as Flipper Pro. Install both and you have total
control over the Palmsize PC.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="How you want it?"><font face="Arial">How you want
it?</font></a></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial">By default, Sticky Buttons provides
instant, one-tap access to all the key applications built-into
the Palmsize device. Contacts, Calculator, Notetaker -- all just
one tap away. No need to open the Start menu: just tap, and
that's it. You can select which of these icons (if any) to
display, and also assign up to four more of your own favourite
programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Using Sticky Buttons is easy, as the
buttons are part of the Active Desktop. This means they can be
turned on or off from the standard Windows CE Display properties
window, shuffled around the screen and mixed with existing
components.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Sticky Buttons can be configured to work
the way you want it to. Don't adapt to use your Palmsize, let it
adapt to suit your way of working. Make your Palmsize PC desktop
your own personal computing space, set up exactly the way you
need it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">These icons provide quick access
to important features. Need to find a name in contacts? Access
general Windows CE Help files (as well as help on Sticky Buttons
itself)? Perhaps you want to check battery power, or check out
which programs you have running. Most impressive of all is the
Kill function: the skull and crossbones. One tap and all the
programs in the background, using up your memory, are history.
Use it with caution!</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What does it do?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. In a nutshell, it adds icons to
        Palmsize PC making it easy to launch programs. Instead of
        opening the Start menu, you tap the icon of the program
        you want to start. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How is Sticky Buttons
        different from other launch programs?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. The key difference is that the
        launch icons are displayed on the Active Desktop, not on
        a secondary window. Tap on the desktop icon (in the
        bottom right of the taskbar) and your launch icons are
        available.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How large is the
        configuration program?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. The configuration program is
        between 140 and 180K in size. It can moved to a CF card
        if required, or even deleted if you are happy with your
        button configuration.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How is it installed?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. </font><a
        href="stickyinstall.htm"><font face="Arial">Click here</font></a><font
        face="Arial"> for a full, step-by-step guide to
        installing Sticky Buttons</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What else does Sticky
        Buttons do?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A.As well as completely changing
        the appearance of your active desktop, and greating
        simplifying the way in which you will use your Palmsize
        PC, Sticky Buttons also has a bank of utility icons for
        power, battery and task management.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I choose which
        programs appear on the desktop?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. You can select all, some or
        none of the eight key Windows CE applications, and up to
        four of your own favourite programs too. The icons for
        your own user-defined programs are created from the
        programs themselves (note: except on colour systems,
        where a default icon is used instead).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does it work in colour /
        monochrome?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong><img src="sb-st4.gif"
        align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="266"></strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, it works on both colour (or
        <em>color</em> if you prefer) and monochrome Palmsize
        PCs. It's been extensively tested on a Philips Nino 300,
        Casio E-10, and Hewlett-Packard Jornada 420. The icons
        are colour by default, and so look extra smart on colour
        systems, however the extra shades also make the most of
        any display: whether four or sixteen shades of grey, or
        full colour. This screen shot is from a Casio E-10, which
        has only four shades of grey: the display still looks
        clear and sharp.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As a bonus, on four-grey monochrome
        systems the user-defined shortcut icons are created from
        the application programs they represent, to look even
        smarter. Of course, this feature is optional: you can
        stick to the default icons if you wish.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I use my own
        graphics?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A, Yes! And we'll be providing some
        free samples very soon for you to download, with details
        on how to use them to give your Palmsize PC a unique new
        look. New logo files and icon button images are easy to
        create and install, and a free Themes utility for
        existing owners will be available soon.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I mix the Sticky
        Buttons Active Desktop item with other components?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, Sticky Buttons appears as a
        standard desktop component, so you can switch on the
        other components, alter the order and so on. You could
        elect to use only the four user defined buttons for
        example, or only the utilties, and have plenty of space
        for other components such as appointments, tasks or a
        logo.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How can I uninstall it
        completely?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. You can use the standard Remove
        Programs utility. However, due to the way active desktop
        components are inserted into the system, this will still
        leave a few files lurking around. Follow </font><a
        href="stickyremove.htm"><font face="Arial">this link</font></a><font
        face="Arial"> to see how to purge your system totally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does it work on a
        handheld PC / handheld PC Pro?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. No, only Palmsize PCs. Bottom
        line: do not buy this program if your Wndows CE computer
        has an integral keyboard!</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Try the themes! Already there
        are three to pick from. Why not make your own --
        instructions are on the themes page.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Have you switched the Create
        Icons option on, and seen nothing but empty squares? Just
        re-assign the user defined buttons to different
        applications (or the same ones, in a different order) so
        that the system has a chance to re-create the icon files.
        Remember, this option only works on mono Palm-size PCs,
        due to a limitation in Windows CE.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Do without the Taskbar. Try
        using the Autohide to turn it off. You'll have access to
        the important applications anyway, thanks to Sticky
        Buttons. If you are worried about getting back to the
        desktop quickly, assign Flipper Pro to one of the
        Palm-sized PC's three or four application buttons.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Wondering what the icon which
        StickyButtons creates for itself is supposed to
        represent? That's Barney: the much-loved cat that used to
        help out with programming, and also used to play with the
        glass jar (see the Sicky FAQ). Barney is also the
        code-name of the Sticky Buttons project.<br>
        <br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Want a larger logo to appear
        at the top of the screen? Switch off the Sticky Buttons
        graphic and date, and use the default Window CE desktop
        component called &quot;logo&quot;. You can save your own
        graphic called &quot;dttitle.gif&quot; over the one in
        Windows/Temporary Internet Files.<br>

        </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Want to hurry up the refresh?
        Go to Start/Settings/Display and tap OK. This can also
