<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Unlike any other task launching application, Sticky 
Buttons actually places familiar buttons right on the Active Desktop. No matter 
what other applications the user has installed, when they switch their new Nino 
on, the icons will be there waiting for them. In the screenshot above, taken 
from a Nino 300, the icons are in greyscale. On a colour screen, the icons will 
be in up to 256 colours: making an ideal colourful image to greet the 
user.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>There's more: the logo at the top of the screen can 
be ANY gif file. There is no reason why it couldn't be a Nino or Phlips logo for 
example. Here's a mock-up of what a colour Sticky Buttons screen could look 
like:</FONT></P>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2><IMG height=325 
src="Sticky Buttons_files/colournino.gif" width=200></FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>By default, Sticky Buttons provides instant, one-tap 
access to all the key applications built-into the Nino. Contacts, Calculator, 
Notetaker -- all just one tap away. No need to open the Start menu: just tap, 
and that's it. The user can select which of these icons to display, and also 
assign up to four more for their own favourite programs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Using Sticky Buttons is easy, as the buttons are part 
of the Active Desktop. This means they can be turned on or off from the standard 
Windows CE Display properties window.</FONT></P>
