<p><font face="Arial">TankZone was the <u>first</u> 3D game
released for Windows CE. We've now taken the same game code, and
wrapped it in some delicious colour graphics, and it's ready to
take full advantage of your new colour Jornada Palmsize PC. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">As always, you don't have to buy TankZone
Pro -- it's a free download. However, if you like it, you are
obligated to make a donation to the local charity of your choice.
We would be grateful if you would email us just to let us know
who you have selected to give your money to: we won't publish the
details, we are just interested.</font></p>

<h2><font size="4" face="Arial">I want it!</font></h2>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Then download it! </font><a
href="TankZoneJornadaSetup.exe"><font size="3" face="Arial">Click
on this link</font></a><font size="3" face="Arial"> and you will
download the self-extracting archive to your desktop PC. Connect
up your Jornada to your PC for a sync, and then double-click the
downloaded file. It will automatically install the game onto your
Palmsize, and add a link under Start/Programs/Games. Please use
the default installation directory.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">We also suggest you sign up to the
</font><a href="../mailinglist.htm" target="_top"><font size="3"
face="Arial">Sticky Software Mailing List</font></a><font
size="3" face="Arial">. This is your best bet for staying up to

information and special offers. This list is not a daily
spam-fest, and your details will not be sold or given to anyone
else.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Some Frequently Asked Questions</font></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does this work now?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes! There was a problem with the MFC
DLL file in a previous version. This has been fixed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Do I have to tap the on-screen
buttons to control it?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No, you can use the jog wheel to rotate
left/right, Action button to more forward and Escape button to
fire. It's recommended you switch off the button sound effects.
It's a good idea to turn off these sound effects anyway, as they
are irritating.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I download it directly to my
Jornada Palmsize PC?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Well, yes in theory you can, but you
can't install it or use it if you do. Download it to your desktop
PC and run it from there. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Will it work on a different
PsPC? For example, my Compaq Aero/E-100/Nino 500?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No, it will only work on the Jornada
420.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Will it work on my handheld PC?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Nope. There are other versions for these
models elsewhere on the Sticky Software website.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. So let me get this right, it's
free, yeah?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No! It's not free. It's charity-ware. If
you play it, you are under a moral obligation to make a
charitible donation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. In the pictures above, the
taskbar at the bottom of the screen is missing. Howd'ya do that? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Go to Start/Settings/Taskbar and click
on Auto Hide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. So, it's public domain, right?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No! It's not public domain. It's
copyright. You may not sell this game, or store it elsewhere on
the Internet for downloading. You may not put it on a CD-ROM. You
may not provide a link directly to the .exe file, only to this
page, or the Sticky Software Web site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Do you do other Windows CE
software?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, heaps. Here's the link to the rest
of the </font><a href="../index.htm" target="_top"><font
face="Arial">Sticky Software</font></a><font face="Arial"> site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. But, let's be honest here, it's
free, yeah?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Nope. It's not free. If you use it, and
don't make a donation, you are breaking the terms of the user
license agreement. </font></p>
