        Questions</font><font face="Arial"> </font><p><font
        color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does Pocket
        Universe run on the H/PC Pro?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">A. If the HPC Pro
        in question uses the MIPS or SH3 processor, then yes.
        Pocket Universe should automatically adjust its screen
        size to suit. For example, users tell us that Pocket
        Universe runs on the Vadem Clio / Sharp TriPad. Models
        based on other processers, such as the new HP Jornada
        based on the StrongARM processor, are not currently
        supported. When the necessary tools become available (not
        always easy in Europe, sadly) a compatible version will
        be released.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does
        Pocket Universe support colour displays?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">A. Yes, the
        Handheld PC version will display in colour (blue sky,
        green glass, red grid lines) on colour models. You can
        switch to a more contrast-y monochrome view if you wish.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>Q. Where is
        the on-line help in the Palmsize PC version?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. The Microsoft
        guidelines explain how all Palmsize PC programs which
        offer on-line help should do so <em>not</em> with a
        separate menu (which would take up too much space on the
        screen) but by using the Help option present in the Start
        Bar. In other words, all you have to do to read Pocket
        Universe's on-line help is click on Start and Help when
        the program is running :-)</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Are there any other programs
        for handheld computers like Pocket Universe?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Currently not. There are some
        other astronomy programs, but they work in a completely
        different way. Rather than generating a dynamic view for
        your location, they feature a static star map. It's like
        holding a piece of paper over your head -- much harder to
        use than Pocket Universe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. When installing, I&nbsp;get a
        message telling me that a DLL&nbsp;file is already in use
        or in ROM, and then asks if it should try again. What is
        happening?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. The Installation routine is set
        up to copy all the files needed to your HPC. This
        includes a DLL file called MFCCE20.DLL. Some HPCs (mainly
        HP&nbsp;models) already have this file in ROM - this
        saves RAM. When the installation routine asks you if it
        should try again, simply say no and it will skip over the
        file. Pocket Universe will install and run perfectly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Does Pocket Universe run on
        Palmsize PCs?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. A new version specifically
        designed for Palmsized PCs can be found </font><a
        href="../Palm/pu.htm"><font face="Arial">here</font></a><font
        face="Arial">. IMPORTANT: Don't buy the HPC version and
        expect it to run on the Palmsize PC or vice versa!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I have the Palmsize PC
        version. When I select Save, I get a message about an
        unexpected error.</strong><br>
        <br>
        A. This has been corrected on latest PsPC versions. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Will it run under
        Windows CE v1?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. No, and there is unlikely to be
        a version for this version of the OS. Sorry!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Q. Occasionally
        when I tap the screen to centre an object, it doesn't
        appear in the middle of the screen.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. First of all,
        make sure that your stylus is calibrated properly. Use
        the stylus applet from the Control Panel. Sometimes when
        Pocket Universe is asked to centre the display at a point
        a long way from its current location, it will be
        ever-so-slightly wide of the mark. All you need to do is
        tap the item you want to centre a second time for a more
        accurate fix.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Q. When I try to
        set up the date, time and location for an eclipse the sun
        and moon don't seem to be totally overlapped as they
        should. Why is this?</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. In order to make
        Pocket Universe run as quickly as possible, some of the
        calculations involved are simplified slightly. Make sure
        you switch on the Parallax option from the Display Option
        as this will help. Sticky Software will try and improve
        the accuracy of the sun and moon positions, and will
        release a free update to all existing owners if and when
        it becomes available. In general use, the accuracy of
        Pocket Universe should prove more than adequate.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Q. After I enter
        my location, it doesn't stay when I restart Pocket
        Universe.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. Make sure you
        select Save Settings from the File Menu to store your
        current settings. It's these which will be used every
        time Pocket Universe starts.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Q. I need a
        quick way of zooming in the out. The I and O keys don't
        do it quickly enough.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. Remember that
        you can use the Shift key at the same time to increase
        the jump in magnification. However, the easiest and
        quickest way to zoom is to use the toolbox's Zoom
        buttons. Tap them to quickly select between four
        different settings.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Q. I've noticed
        that the Sun and Moon don't seem to be the right size in
        the display.</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. The Sun and Moon
        are drawn as disks of a fixed size, unless the Display
        Option Real Size is switched on.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><b>Q. What is the
        TimeZone?</b></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. As a result of
        the Earth being spherical and rotating, the Sun appears
        to rise and set at different times depending on where you
        are. We could use one universal time, but then when it
        was sunrise in London at 9am, it could be the middle of
        the night in Sidney, Australia: but still 9am. For this
        reason the world is split into TimeZones. These are an
        offset from the &quot;official&quot; time, when is
        Greenwich Mean Time. GMT is the time at Greenwich in
        England: the location of 0 degrees Longitude. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"><strong>Q. When I
        Goto the Sun or Moon, they aren't there!</strong></font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">A. Check to see if
        you have switched on the display option &quot;Hide
        Low&quot;, as this causes all objects (other than
        constellation outlines) beneath the horizon not to be
        displayed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What is daylight saving time?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Depending on the season, the
        days seem to get longer or shorter. To make the most of
        available daylight, some countries shift the time one
        hour forward for the months of March to October (or
        October to March in the southern hemisphere). The exact
        dates will differ from country to country. Checking the
        Daylight Saving from the Set Time/Date dialog will cause
        Pocket Universe to assume that your clock is actually one
        hour ahead of what your local time should be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. Redrawing the screen seems to
        take a long time. Can't you create a larger display and
        then scroll around it?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. It's true that on some HPC's it
        can take a irritatingly long time to update the display.
        This is due to the number of calculations involved, and
        all the graphics operations required. To speed it up,
        make sure you are only displaying the objects you need
        to: switch off the horizon for example, and constellation
        outlines. It's not possible to construct the display in
        advance and scroll around it, because the view changes
        totally depending on where you are looking. Remember the
        sky appears to be on the inside of a large sphere, not
        flat on a map or plan. The best way to speed up the
        display is to use a fast HPC: the Philips Velo models are
        exceptionally fast, as are current the Compaq models.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Q. What are Jupiter's Moons?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. The giant gas planet Jupiter has
        a host of small planetoids orbiting it. The four largest
        were discovered by the astronomer Galileo, one of the
        first people to ever point a telescope at the night sky.
        They are known as the Galilean Moons in his honour. You
        can see them yourself with a small telescope or even
        binoculars. They appear as four points of light close to
        the disk of Jupiter. Some people claim to be able to see
        the brightest with their naked eye!</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I want to bring my
        handheld outside, anything to be wary of?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Take care with all electrical
        equipment if there is a heavy dew. When bringing your
        computer back inside, be careful with condensation
        problems. When using you handheld outside, the backlight
        may alter your night vision for the worse - consider
        using a red torch instead, or a stylus with a built-in
        light, such as those from Panache Ltd.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Will you add support for
        Satellite tracking to Pocket Universe?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. We're considering it, but can't
        promise anything at this stage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can Pocket Universe be
        connected to a telescope?</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A. Currently not. However, we are
        working on adding features to allow control of the Meade
        LX200. We are hoping to test this soon, and will make the
        upgrade available free to all existing owners. </font></p>
