program, <em>ever</em>!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unlike any other task launching
application, Sticky Buttons actually places familiar buttons
right on the Active Desktop. No matter what other applications
the user has installed, when they switch their new Nino on, the
icons will be there waiting for them. In the screenshot above,
taken from a Nino 300, the icons are in greyscale. On a colour
screen, the icons will be in up to 256 colours: making an ideal
colourful image to greet the user.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There's more: the logo at the top
of the screen can be ANY gif file. There is no reason why it
couldn't be a Nino or Phlips logo for example. Here's a mock-up
of what a colour Sticky Buttons screen could look like:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><img
src="colournino.gif" width="200" height="325"></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">By default, Sticky Buttons
provides instant, one-tap access to all the key applications
built-into the Nino. Contacts, Calculator, Notetaker -- all just
one tap away. No need to open the Start menu: just tap, and
that's it. The user can select which of these icons to display,
and also assign up to four more for their own favourite programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Using Sticky Buttons is easy, as
the buttons are part of the Active Desktop. This means they can
be turned on or off from the standard Windows CE Display
properties window.</font></p>
