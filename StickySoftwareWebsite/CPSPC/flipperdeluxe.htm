<h1><font size="5" face="Arial">Flipper Deluxe</font></h1>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Flipper is a small task-switching
program which packs a lot into one, unobtrusive taskbar icon. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="../Palm/fd1.gif"
width="300" height="228"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Flipper Deluxe is a Task Manager,
but one which is both easy to use and packed with features.
Install it, and then launch it &#150; you'll notice a new icon
appears in the tooltray at the bottom of the screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Flipper is this easy to use:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Single-tap </strong>on the
Flipper icon, and the currently open tasks in the background are
shuffled around. Your current program (or desktop) flips to the
background, and a previous program flips to the foreground. Keep
single-tapping and all the open applications will appear, one at
a time. A good hint is to assign Flipper to one of the
user-definable buttons on the Palm-size PC. Then you only need to
press the button to cycle all your open applications.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Double-tap</strong> on the
icon, the currently open task (excluding the desktop) will be
closed. No fuss, no hunting for the Task Manager. One click, and
the current task is history. This is without a doubt, the easiest
way yet to keep your applications and tasks in check.</font></p>

<h2><font size="5" face="Arial">More features...</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Flipper has another feature.
Assign Flipper to one of your Palmsize PC's user-defined buttons,
and you can quickly flip between applications with a single
click. Just press the button, the next application flips to the
foreground.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">To open the <strong>pop-up menu</strong>,
tap and hold the stylus on the Flipper icon for slightly longer
than usual. The menu will pop up. The first items in this menu
are the currently running applications. To jump to them, just tap
its entry in the menu.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="../Palm/fd2.gif"
width="377" height="280"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The remaining options are as
follows:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Kill current task</strong><br>
        This kills the current application. It's does the same
        thing as double-tapping the icon.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Kill all but current</strong><br>
        This kills all the other programs, other than the one you
        are currently using (and/or the desktop). This is a very
        fast way to quickly clear out memory.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Options...</strong><br>
        This brings up a new dialog, with extra information and
        options. (See later).</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Run... </strong><br>
        This brings up the Windows CE &quot;run&quot; dialog,
        into which you can enter program or document names in
        order to launch applications manually.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font size="5" face="Arial">Options Window</font></h2>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><img src="../Palm/fd3.gif"
width="440" height="288"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The options window provides you
with a quick summary of the memory available on your Palm-size
PC, and the current status of the batteries. There are two other
options:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>1. Autokill</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When this item is checked, Flipper
will periodically close all the but the current window. So if you
are using your Palm-size PC for some time-intensive task, you
won't have to worry about saving memory or closing unwanted
applications. Flipper does it for you. Please try this option.
While it mightn't suit everyone's style of working, it can be
useful.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>2. Startup Sound</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">This feature will trigger a sound
(called &quot;flipper.wav&quot;) when you power on your Palm-size
PC. Use this to provide amusing sound effects. One catch is that
the sound will only be triggered if you have a CF card attached
to your Palm-size PC. You might want to switch off this option if
it interferes with your one-touch voice recording, or alarm clock
sounds.</font></p>
