        As you might have guessed, Sticky Software isn't like
        other software companies. You might suspect that the
        people who run Sticky Software aren't like ordinary
        people. In fact, truth be told, they aren't like ordinary
        people. They aren't even people! There's just me: a
        disembodied brain floating in a jar of nutrients.</font><p

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite what you might
        think, generally my day is very productive: as long as
        Mrs Sticky remembers to top up the jar with hydroponics
        solution and keep the cat out of my office, I can get a
        lot of work done. Thanks to the ECG/RJ11 card which came
        as an optional extra for this model of jar, I can
        communicate directly with this Windows PC, and so design
        web pages or fire up Visual C++ for a spot of
        programming.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This month for example, I
        had the joy of receiving a new piece of Windows CE
        hardware: a </font><a href="http://www.vadem.com"
        target="_top"><font size="2" face="Arial">Vadem Clio</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial">. This is the computer with the
        large, flip screen which allows the unit to be used
        either as a desktop computer or a handheld tablet (or a
        funny easel mode for simulating a huge-screen TV to
        Barbie dolls). Side by side with the </font><a
        href="http://www.hp.com/jornada" target="_top"><font
        size="2" face="Arial">Jornada 820</font></a><font
        size="2" face="Arial"> I would have a very difficult job
        trying to decide which to buy. I like the fact that the
        Jornada has support for the REX, but the Clio is so much
        more interesting.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking of Jornadas, the
        new HP colour palmsize PC is now on-sale in the US, and
        should reach these shores by the end of this month. Can't
        wait! Colour makes the displays so much easier to read,
        and makes games so much more interesting. I've plans for
        some great entertainment software &#150; it's about time
        there was something other than tedious card games to
        play!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">You might be wondering
        what kind of day-to-day work a brain in a tank could
        possible perform. I'll tell you: computer magazine
        journalism. It's easy &#150; as a freelance, I never need
        to turn up to an office (and risk embarrassing spills, or
        worse, being mistaken for a water cooler). All I have to
        do is examine at new software and hardware (or read the
        press releases instead), write an article and email it
        in. A month later, a cheque arrives in the post. I've
        been doing this now for over ten years, and no-one has
        rumbled. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sometimes editors ask for
        a photograph (generally new editors, who want to publish
        pictures of all their staff as an excuse to print their
        own photograph, twice the size, on the opening editorial
        page). I usually get a male model to stand-in for me, and
        this certainly increases the number of emails I get!</font></p>
