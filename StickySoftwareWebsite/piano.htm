        terrible tunes with your HPC.<br>
        Download this little handheld keyboard, and tap out your

        tapping ability.<br>

        Please note that this is a very, very basic system. The
        only menu option<br>
        which does anything is &quot;Music/Keyboard&quot;. Sticky
        Software will not<br>
        be offering support for this program at this stage.<br>

        This is important -- the directory must be under &quot;My
        HPC.&quot; No other locations<br>
        will work. If you don't hear anything, then this is the
