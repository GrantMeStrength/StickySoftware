<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Why can't I use existing Windows
CE software on my Jornada 820?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. When the handheld and palmsize PC's
first appeared, they were based on one of two processors: a MIPS
or an SH3 device. The HP Jornada is one of the first devices to
use a StrongARM processor instead. This chip is fast, uses little
power and has built-in features such as support for USB and the
ability to mirror video output on an external monitor (which is
why a Jornada can be used with a monitor all the time, not just
for displaying Pocket PowerPoin presentations).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The catch is that as the CPU is different
and so incompatible with existing software. The Jornada therefore
cannot use MIPS or SH3 software &#150; including Pocket Streets
for example. It's up to the authors to re-compile their software
especially for the StrongARM platform, and this requires an
update to their software tools (the compilers, installers and so
on). Microsoft has <em>still</em> to release the full Software
Development Kit for the HPC Pro platform.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I use programs for the
HP620/660/680 on my Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No -- these HPCs use a different CPU,
the SH3, which isn't compatible with the Jornada 820's StrongARM
processor. See above.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What's the difference between
the Jornada 820 and Jornada 820e?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. The 820e doesn't have the built-in
software modem. The 820e is on sale in Europe (not including the
UK) as the many different Eurpean telecommunications companies
make it difficult to make a modem which confirms to all
standards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I run Pocket Streets?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. There isn't a stand-alone, free download
version of Pocket Streets for the Jornada 820. However, new
versions of Microsoft's route planning / mapping software include
a version which is compatible. For example, Autoroute 2000 GB
supports a Jornada version to view street maps.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I run DOS programs on the
Jornada? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, by using an emulator. The program </font><a
href="http://www.pyram-id.demon.co.uk/XTCE.html"><font size="3"
face="Arial">XTCE</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> </font><font
size="3" face="Arial">is now available, and will enable to you
run old DOS programs on your Jornada. In general you should look
for a CE version of your software first...</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How do I perform a back-up of my
Jornada? I want to keep a copy of everything save on my PC.</strong></font><font
color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong> </strong></em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Two ways. </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">1. Use the HB Backup utility. This
    creates a single file (or two) from the entire contents of
    the Jornada's internal memory. This file can be created in
    internal memory, or on a CF card. Once it's done, copy the
    file(s) to your desktop PC next time your Jornada is linked
    up for syncing.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial">2. Use the backup features of Windows
    CE Services. Next time you sync, open the Mobile Devices
    window on your PC and find Tools/Backup. This will make a
    backup of the Jornada's internal memory on your desktop PC.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What's the Jornada 420/8?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. A colour Palmsized PC. More details from
the </font><a
href="http://www.hp.com/jornada/palmtops/hp400/400_overview.html"><font
face="Arial">HP website</font></a><font face="Arial">. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Is it possible to sync at speeds
faster than 19,200?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. Set the speed on your Jornada
(Control Panel, Communication Properties, PC Connection,
Change...) and also on your desktop PC (Control Panel, System,
Device manager, Modem, Serial cable on COM?:). </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Is it possible to open a
DOS-like shell on a Windows CE computer?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Only the HPC Pro (e.g. the Jornada) has
a text-based shell window built-in (run CMD.EXE from the
Start/Run/ prompt to open it). However, this isn't a true DOS or
DOS compatible shell: it's just a window into which you can type
some commands (such as Help) and run text-only programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I use the US version of the
Jornada in the UK?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. The power supply is auto-sensing
and works perfectly. The modem also appears to work, once you
have a suitable lead.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How can I get images from my
digital camera onto my Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. If your camera uses a CF card to store
pictures, you should be able to simply insert it into the
Jornada's CF slot and read the files. If your camera saves the
images in a &quot;finished&quot; format such as JPEGs, you should
be able to view them too. Thereotically, SmartMemory used in some
cameras, can be placed in a PCMCIA adapter and read too, although
I've not tried this. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To copy images from a camera to a Jornada
by other means: IrDA, Serial or USB for example, requires that a
suitable driver is written for the Jornada. I know of no such
utility at the moment.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Editing and viewing pictures from digital
cameras can be done with third party software, such as that from </font><a
href="http://www.sierraimaging.com"><font face="Arial">Sierra
Imaging</font></a><font face="Arial">.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I save the individual
databases, not just the PIM ones?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. There is no supplied utility to save
individual databases, buy a third party product called FlashBack
from </font><a href="http://www.developerone.com"><font
face="Arial">Developer One</font></a><font face="Arial"> does
just that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What is TrueSync for? </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">A. It's software which allows you
to quickly and easily copy all the key data from your Jornada's
PIM database (contacts, calendar data etc) to a REX credit-card
sized computer. Only HP provide this software, and it is a very
good selling point. The REX is a very handly little device to
have with you, and using it with a Jornada is easier than with a
desktop PC in my experience.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="Audio"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Audio</strong></font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. When I record sounds, the
quality seems a little rough. Is this normal?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Sadly it appears that it is. To maximise
sound quality, use the highest possible sampling frequency and
bit-size, from Tools/Recording format. PCM gives the best
quality, and 22,050Hz, 16bit mono is probably as good as you need
for speech. There is a trade-off between quality and the memory
consumed. I've found that there seems to be an automatic
recording level process at work, which brings up the level (and
hiss), so for best results get really, really close to the
microphone.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Why do I get the option to
record in stereo when there is only one microphone?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. This function is probably just part of
Windows CE / the audo driver, and is included by default. It's
safe to assume this means that the Jornada is compatible (i.e.
can replay) stereo WAV files (although obviously only in mono)
which might be useful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I replay music on my
Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. Although you can copy across WAV
files in various formats, the best way is to use the MP3 format,
as your music files will therefore consume a lot less storage
space without compromising quality. A free MP3 player is
available from </font><a href="http://www.xaudio.com/"><font
face="Arial">XAudio</font></a><font face="Arial">. You can use
other software on your PC to take tracks from your own audio CDs,
save them in MP3 format and then copy them to your Jornada. The
sound quality is surprisingly good through the Jornada's built-in
speaker.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I add an external
microphone, headphone socket or loudspeaker to the Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No. It's theoretically possible to take
your Jornada apart and solder in a socket for headphones, but I'm
certainly not going to try it. The sound would still be in mono
anyway -- there is no hardware support for stereo sounds.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does the Jornada have a sound
card? Can I add one?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. In common with all Windows CE devices,
the Jornada will play (and record) sound. It doesn't have a
fully-fledged soundcard as such: it's not SoundBlaster compatible
or anything like that, but it can replay WAV files with a good
range of quality settings. It can play sound effects in games,
windows warning noises, screen taps, your sampled voice notes
etc.. With appropriate software, other Windows CE devices can
play MOD (music) files and MP3 files, so it's safe to assume
these facilities will be available on the Jornada soon enough. As
for adding sound hardware, well as it's possible to buy
soundcards in PCMCIA format, it's theoretically possible at least
that a MIDI player could be written</font>.</p>

<p><a name="Memory"><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Memory</strong></font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I want to use the 16Mb memory
expansion. Will it drain my batteries quicker?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. This is unlikely: the power drain would
be minimal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Will more memory speed up my
Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Only if you are running very low on
memory beforehand, causing the Jornada to page in and out other
memory blocks. In general there shouldn't be any performance
increase simply by adding more memory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Sometimes my Jornada claims it
has run out of memory, even though there is plenty left when I
visit the System applet in the control panel. What's up? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. It would appear that memory in a CE
system eventually becomes fragmented, and sometimes applications
don't release all the memory they should: it's very easy to fix
this, simply close all open applications and poke the reset
button. You won't lose any data, and your Jornada will run
faster. It's worth doing this about once a week.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What's the maximum size of CF
memory I can add to my Jornada? I've heard 32Mb mentioned a lot. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. 32mb is the limit to conventional RAM
supported by Windows CE (it comes with 16Mb as standard, and
another 16Mb can be fitted under the keyboard). This is the
memory which appears in the System control panel appet. CF
(Compact Flash) memory on the other hand is different: it
effective appears as a hard disk to the computer. Although 32Mb
cards are common, others report using 48Mb CF cards with no
problems. As larger cards become available, we'll hear if they
are compatible too. However, with 32Mb of ordinary RAM, and two
48Mb CF cards (one in the PCMCIA slot) this is probably more RAM
than most Jornada users would ever need.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How can I expand my Jornada's
memory?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. In four different ways. One: buy a CF
card, and shove it into the slot on the left. Two: buy a CF card,
put it into a PCMCIA/CF Adapter and shove it into the slot on the
right. Three: buy a SmartMedia card, instert it in a PCMCIA
adapter and shove it into the slot on the right (NOTE: I've not
tested this -- it should work though!) Four: buy the official HP
Jornada memory expansion and install it in it's secret little
slot under the keyboard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What's the difference between
these approaches?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Using a CF card (or SmartMedia card) is
like adding a disk drive to a PC. It's an ideal place to store
applications, documents and sound files. CF memory is reliable:
if your Jornada has a total brain-wipe megacrash for some reason
(say, you remove the battery pack and leave it until the back-up
batteries go flat, for example) the contents of the CF will
remain entact. This is why using the HP Backup Utility to copy
PIM and other data to the CF card is such a good idea.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Adding the Jornada memory expansion adds
another 16Mb of RAM to the standard memory pool. This is the
memory which is used to store applications by default, but also
the memory which the computer uses when it's actually running.
Contacts, To Do lists, Calendar data and so on are kept in this
memory. If you plan on storing a lot of PIM data or running some
very greedy programs, the additional 16Mb will be very useful.
Also, it doesn't use up any of the expansion slots which can be
more convenient. This memory will also be faster to access than
CF memory, which can make a difference when using a program like
Pocket Streets.</font></p>

<p><a name="Java and Internet Explorer"><font size="4"
face="Arial"><strong>Java and Internet Explorer</strong></font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. When I visit certain Web sites,
they don't display properly on my Jornada. They work fine on my
desktop. What gives?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Although the version of Pocket Internet
Explorer included in the Jornada contains many improvements over
the version in earlier Windows CE machines, it's still not
perfect. It's never going to be as packed with features as, say,
Internet Explorer 4. Memory limitations, processor speed: these
and other factors mean that Pocket Internet Explorer is -- and
always will be -- a cut-down version of Internet Explorer. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It <em>will</em> view the majority of web
sites, but sites which use Java or other non-HTML technologies
won't work. Some web sites, such as home banking sites, require a
very secure browser. Although PIE does have encyption built into
it, the security keys it uses are smaller than on desktop
version. Microsoft have made available an upgrade from their web
site to 128bit security, but this is only available to users from
US and Canada. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This still leaves the problem of
JavaScript/JScript support. Sometimes pages use extra scripting
tags which just don't work. The access counter on the index page
of this site, for example, always shows 000000 when viewed using
PIE. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. But my Jornada came with a Java
Virtual Machine program. Doesn't this mean I can use Java Web
sites?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No. The JVM isn't integrated in to the
Pocket Internet Explorer application. It's for running
stand-alone Java applications. (See later for more details on the
JVM.) Pocket Internet Explorer understands some basic J-Script -
in fact, you could potentially write simple programs using it -
but not fully fledged Java.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I've installed the Java Virtual
Machine. What exactly can I do with it? Can I write my own
programs?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes and no. The Java Virtual Machine
consists of a program called &quot;jview&quot; and some dll
files. Theoretically, these provides you with all the tools you
need to run any software developed in Java. In practice, I've
discovered the following:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/java.gif" width="443"
height="309"></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Arial">Java &quot;programs&quot; are called
        Classes. For example, the Java program &quot;hello&quot;
        used to test the installation consists of the files
        &quot;hello.class&quot; and one other file,
        &quot;frame1.class&quot;. If you open up
        &quot;hello.class&quot; in a text editor, you will see
        that it's not simply source code. It's been compiled by a
        Java compiler program from a file called
        &quot;hello.java&quot;. You are <em>not</em> given a
        compiler with the JVM you've just installed on your
        Jornada, so you cannot develop code using only the
        Jornada.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Although the documentation suggests
        you use the Start/Run dialog to start applications, you
        might find it easier to use the version of the Shell.
        Type Start/Run/cmd.exe to open the Shell. I created a
        shortcut to this on the desktop, to make it easy to open
        a shell.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">While you should be able to download
        and use any Java.class you see on the Internet, most of
        these programs are in the form of &quot;applets&quot;.
        These are special Java programs designed to be run from
        an Internet Browser. Often they appear in a window inside
        the Internet browser. I have yet to have any success
        making any java applet run on Pocket Internet Explorer,
        even when following the example applet HTML code in the
        readme file, and using the standard Hello program. If you
        have managed to do this, please let me know.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Although applets don't seem to work,
        the stand-alone version of Java classes -- known as
        applications -- do. This is what the
        &quot;frame1.class&quot; file does: it creates a window
        for the &quot;hello.class&quot; to execute in. If you
        download classes which are intended to stand alone as
        applications, they may work.<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">I have written my own (simple) Java
        programs and executed them on the Jornada. I used the
        Microsoft tool J++ to write and compile the code from the
        .java format into a .class, which I then copied to the
        Jornada. From the J++ Wizard, I specified I wanted to
        create an applet AND an application, as this created the
        frame code. The program worked first time. <br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">This means it's possible to create
        sophisticated Java programs using the J++ environment
        (and hopefully others, such as the JDK from Sun) and run
        on them on your Jornada.</font></li>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. My Jornada comes with a utility
called HP Dialer for connecting to the Internet via the built-in
modem. However, when I use it to dial, I get a &quot;no
carrier&quot; message every time as soon as the modem connects. I
am in Europe.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Use the Remote Networking utility
instead, this works fine. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Does the UK version of the
Jornada have a modem built in?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. The rest of Europe has to make do
with the 820e model, which lacks the modem. However, as the
Jornada has a standard PC Card slot (PCMCIA slot) it's possible
to buy a large range of modem cards and use them instead. Please
check that your modem card is Windows CE compatible before you
purchase it!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I used a PCMCIA modem card
with the Jornada? Will this speed up performance? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. You can, and indeed, if you have a
European 820e you will have to. Tests would seem to indicate that
it doesn't operate much faster than the built-in modem. The
bottleneck appears to be Windows CE, not the modem itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I access AOL email with my
Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. As far as I know, no you cannot:
certainly you can't with the built-in email client. You would
need a special client program, and so far there isn't one for
Windows CE -- never mind the Jornada. It might (and I'm guessing
here) be possible to use a MSDOS Emulator (in other words, the
forthcoming Jornada port of </font><a
href="http://www.pyram-id.demon.co.uk/XTCE.html"><font
face="Arial">XTCE</font></a><font face="Arial">) to run a DOS
based AOL client. A program called </font><a
href="http://www.smartcodesoft.com/products/handhelds/hh_CE_handMail.html"><font
face="Arial">HandMail</font></a><font face="Arial"> promises AOL
email support, but currently there is no Jornada/HPC Pro support.
There are rumours of a Windows CE AOL client in the works.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I access Lotus products from
my Jornada? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, but you will need to buy extra

(although these are not necessarily available in Jornada
compatible versions -- make you you ask before purchasing!)</font></p>

with my Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, see the page at </font><a

</font></a><font face="Arial">for details.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Is it really the case there is
no spelling checker in the email program? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, it's true. You might want to copy
your email, paste it into Word, check it there and copy it back.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. What about adding a sig to my
email file automatically? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. This isn't included in the email program
either. You might want to consider a program such as Access Panel
which makes it easy to include something like a sig with minimal
effort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. My Jornada screws up my
desktop's Internet dial-up account. </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Make sure you have the DUN 1.2
installed, included as part of the Services 2.2 package.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How fast is the Jornada's
built-in modem? Would a PCMCIA/PC Card modem be faster?</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>Note: This question/answer is
provided by </em></font><a href="rochkind@ix.netcom.com"><font

color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><em>.</em></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. It's obvious to everyone using Pocket
Internet Explorer (PIE) on the Jornada that it's sluggish
relative to desktop systems. It's not so much that pages take a
long time to load, but PIE seems to be so unresponsive. For
instance, if you're tired of waiting and hit the stop button, it
can take from 30 sec. to a minute for anything to really stop. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I was curious about whether an external
modem would speed things up. Maybe the internal modem is just too
slow (despite its 56K rating), or maybe servicing this software
modem was using CPU cycles that should go instead to PIE itself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I ran the following simple test: I
repeatedly refreshed a page containing 15 JPEGs and very little
else, for a total of 366,830 bytes. I tried this 7 times, using
both the internal modem and an external 33.6 modem (not a
PC-Card). I don't know what speed the modems were actually
operating at, as the Jornada doesn't tell me. I do know that the
Netcom dial-up number I used supports 56K service. Here are the
results (times in seconds):</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">(By comparison, my Windows 98 desktop
system with an internal 33.6 modem can load this page in about
108 sec. Also, Front Page, which I used to build the test page,
estimated a load time of 162 sec. at 28.8.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">These results, although limited and subject
to varying network speeds, indicate that the two modems perform
about the same. More significantly, with the external modem, I
noticed the same poor responsiveness that I found with the
internal modem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">So, I conclude that the performance
problems that PIE seems to have relative to what many of us are
used to on larger systems are not due to the modem, but rather
lie with the CPU, the OS, the TCP/IP stack, PIE itself, or with
some combination of these. If I had to guess, I would say the
problem is with PIE. Hopefully, more sophisticated multithreading
can be incorporated into a future version. (In case you're
wondering, Windows CE does already support threads, using the
same model as the other Win32 operating systems.)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I looked at some PC-Card modems today and
almost bought one. Now, I'll save my money!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Is it possible to read the
Jornada's screen outside, in bright sunlight?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes, but only just -- all non-reflective
LCD screens are not happy when there is a lot of light about. The
Jornada's screen is very bright (as there is no touch-sensitive
layer on top) and this gives it the edge. It's still tiring to
try and read it this way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How does the Jornada's screen
compare to the Vadem Clio's / Sharp Tripad's screen? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. It's smaller, brighter and lacks the
touch sensitivity. It's slightly easier to read outdoors in
sunlight. Both screens display 256 colours with a resolution of
640 by 480 pixels. The Jornada's screen shimmers very slightly
when displaying images with a lot of detail such as scanned
photographs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. My Jornada's screen seems to
&quot;shimmer&quot; slightly when displaying coloured images such
as photographs.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. This happens with all Jornadas, and
appears to be a property of the LCD sceen. The screen isn't of
the same high-quality &quot;TFT&quot; variety used in some
laptops. It's only with detailed coloured images that this effect
is apparent, and it's not overpowering. Text and icons on the
Windows CE desktop still look rock steady.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. How come my Jornada can output
video to a monitor all the time, while other CE computers need a
PCMCIA card and then only work using Power Point? </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. This appears to be a unique feature of
the StrongARM-based chipset used in the Jornada 820, which
mirrors the LCD display to the VGA port. Also, when displaying
PowerPoint presentations, resolutions higher than 640 by 480 can
be used.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. I have a HP Jornada. I want to
use it with my IR compatible mobile phone (such as the Ericsson
SH888). I noticed that one of the modems is &quot;Raw IR port on
COM4:&quot;. Can I use this to connect to the phone?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. This doesn't appear to work, at least
when I tested it. You need to create your own IR port, mapped to
COM3:, as with the other handheld / palmsized computers. In other
words, you need to edit the registry. This can be difficult if
you don't have access to a PC based Registry Editor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ericsson have released an up-to-date script
which is comatible with the Jornada. Visit their </font><a

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Using the IR link to my SH888, I

<p><font face="Arial">A. Try reconfiguring the Inbox values to
use POP3 rather than IMAP4 settings.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. My Jornada has a USB port. Can I
plug in any USB hardware? I'm thinking of digital cameras, Zip
drives and so on here.</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Not at the moment. Although the Jornada
has a USB port, it only has one driver built-in as standard and
that is for a mouse. So while you can plug in a mouse and use it
straight away, you cannot connect any other hardware (keyboards,
speakers etc) unless the manufacturer specifically supplies you
with a CE compatible USB driver. If you want a CE driver for a
particular item, you should pester the manufacturer until they
write one. Rumour has it a keyboard driver is in development.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. My desktop PC has a USB port.
Can I perform synchronisations using the USB port on the Jornada?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. No, it's not possible to sync over USB.
This isn't supported by Windows CE. Also, the Jornada's USB port
is a host device and so cannot talk to another host device. This
is a hardware restraint, not a problem with Windows CE. If you
want to speed up the link to your PC, use a compatible Ethernet
card.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Q. Can I use IrDA to sync my
Jornada and my Desktop/Laptop PC?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A. Yes. You'll need suitable IrDA hardware
on your PC (your Jornada has it built-in) and the right drivers
to make use of it. You will need to sync at least once using a
cable.</font></p>
