<h2><font face="Arial">Case in point </font><font color="#FF0000"
size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>NEW</strong></em></font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">When I got my new Jornada 420 home, I
discovered a booklet in the box from Widget: a company which has
been supplying software and peripherals to the PDA market for
years. I was delighted to see on the back page that they were
advertising a case for the Jornada 820, and as you can probably
tell by looking around this site, this is one thing which I've
been desperate to get hold of. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/wc1.jpg" align="left"
hspace="5" width="267" height="297"></font><font face="Arial">The
case isn't actually custom designed for the Jornada 820, instead
it's a more of a general &quot;mobile communications&quot; case.
For this reason, when first opened there is a removable mobile
phone carrier and a little bag for storing other executive
whatsits. Once these are removed, the Jornada fits snugly into
place. You would have a hard job convincing anyone that the case
wasn't a specific Jornada option, the fit is that good.
(Presumably, smaller handheld PCs can hit inside along with the
phone.) Once unzipped, you can open the Jornada screen and as
this hinges open, the case opens up too: no need to remove your
computer to check an address, or consult the Pocket Streets map.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you like, you can attach the supplied
self-adhesive velco (tm) pads to the bottom of your Jornada to
hold it snugly in place, but I'm always wary of sticking anything
to my expensive computers and so didn't bother. The reasonably
high lip around the bottom of the case stopped the Jornada
slipping out, so it wasn't strictly necessary. Nice to have the
option though, as the lower half of the case is all
&quot;anti-velcro&quot; and will lock the pads into place.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I found that the leather from which the
case is made is a little smooth and shiny, which means it could
possibly slip off your knees if you were trying to type on a
train. Perhaps you would be better putting the velcro pads on the
outside of the case, and on your upper-thighs!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/wc2.jpg" align="right"
hspace="0" width="151" height="200"></font><font face="Arial">As
it's a really designed as a general purpose case (let's be
honest, it's a hand-bag - aka purse - for men) there are plenty
of little pen holders, card holders and zipped pockets. I was
able to store some CF cards, pens, and business cards
comfortably. Despite being surprisingly thick, it wasn't possible
to squeeze in the Jornada PSU unit, so that item would have to
travel separately in your main baggage if you needed it with you.
Like wise, my USB mouse would have to make its own way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The overall size (19.5cm x 5cm x 29cm
approximately) is a lot less than a notebook case or briefcase,
so it's easier to carry around on a plane, or when taking the
bus. A little wrist loop can be clipped onto the spine of the
case to help hold it, as it is quite heavy when the Jornada is
placed inside it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The top and bottom of the case have
strengthened panels, and so I'm quite certain that in the event
of dropping it, your Jornada would survive. I'm afraid I wasn't
prepared to test this hypothesis with my own Jornada!</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/wc3.jpg" align="left"
hspace="5" width="200" height="158"></font><font face="Arial">Bottom
line: Yes, the case is a little pricey. However, it's a well-made
peripheral which will provide good protection for your expensive
computer, and you can be sure that it will last for a good few
year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The size is a good match for the Jornada,
as long as you don't need to carry your mouse/PSU/mains lead with
you at all times, and I can't see how it would be possible to
make a case which was more suited. Well done. Widget!</font></p>

<h2><font face="Arial">Making a good case?</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial">The Pouch place is really just around the
corner from me.&nbsp; I went there today and picked up a case for
the Jornada.&nbsp; I was lucky -- they pretty much make these to
order and don't have a lot of stock.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/pouch.jpg" align="left"
hspace="0" width="135" height="182"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I got a black one, but they have a bunch of
bright colors available -- neon hues -- these are used just on
the front, so if you purchase one in color, the back, the strap,
and the flap that folds over the front are black.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The case fits snugly and the computer slips
in easily.&nbsp; The neoprene fabric seems like it will add a
measure of protection, which is the main reason I wanted the
case.&nbsp; The pouch on the back holds the three cables that
came with the computer, without much room for anything else.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Really very simple design, just the front
compartment that fits the computer exactly and the back pouch for
the cables.&nbsp; Sturdy shoulder strap with sturdy clip-on
fasteners -- so you can ditch the strap if you don't need it.
Nothing fancy, not beautiful, but seems very servicable and is
not expensive.&nbsp;</font></p>
