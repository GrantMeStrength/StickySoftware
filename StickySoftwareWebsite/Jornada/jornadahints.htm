<p><font face="Arial"><strong>The case of the missing case... </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Still looking for a carry case for your
Jornada? I know I am.. two more tips for you:</font></p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.thepouch.com"><font face="Arial">The
        Pouch</font></a><font face="Arial">, offers specially
        designed cases for almost all handhelds/palmsize
        computers available. </font><font size="1" face="Arial">Thanks
        to Larry for that one. See a review on the Reviews page!<br>
        </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">David D. writes &quot;I discovered,
        quite by accident, a great case for the Jornada.&nbsp; I
        have been using 3ring binders for planners for years
        until I started with the WinCE stuff.&nbsp; One of the
        binders is a quality leather 8 1/2 by 5 1/2 with a
        removable binder insert.&nbsp; It's just a plastic sleeve
        with the rings that fits into the leather case.&nbsp;
        When removed the Jornada fits almost like it was custom
        made. What's more, people who see it will think I have a
        binder rather than a computer which might make theft less
        likely.&quot;</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>More Wallpaper Tips </strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The colour used as a background to the text
of icons on the desktop can be changed from blue/green, meaning
you don't have to have that colour on your wallpaper image. Go to
Display Properties/Appearance/ and select the item: box element
as Desktop. Alter this colour to suit your wallpaper image. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">You can pop to </font><a
href="jornadaback.htm"><font face="Arial">this</font></a><font
face="Arial"> page for some images to download.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Settings Extras</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The HP Settings utility has a few little
extra features which you may have missed. This is the utility
which is launched by pressing the right-most of the quick launch
keys. You might have noticed that some of the icons have a border
around them: for example, the Speaker icon which adjusts the
volume. Clicking on these icons reveals they are actually
buttons.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Speaker icon launches Volume and
        Sounds applet</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Battery icon launches Power applet</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">The Memory icon launches the
        System/Memory applet</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Noisey Modem?</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you find the Jornada's built-in modem is
a little too noisey (have you been discovered dialing in for your
mail at 2am?) then go to the Device Properties of the modem,
select the Call Options tab and in the box marked Extra Settings,
enter &quot;M0&quot; (that's a letter M, and a zero, without the
quotation marks).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">This setting will force the modem to be
silent.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Carry Case</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Hewlett Packard have no plans for their own
carry case, said the UK people when I spoke to them last week.
However, that doesn't mean your new baby has to get all scuffed.
Here are two ways to look after your investment:</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">1. A company called Case Tech
advertise a custom made case for the Jornada.</font><font
face="Arial">They say it's a &quot;<em>full Grain Black cowhide
leather case for the HP Jornada 820. This is a traditional Diary
Style complete with pockets for credit cards, business
cards,papers,etc. </em>&quot; More details from the </font><a
href="http://www.dxshop.com/_shop/shop-indy.mhtml?shop=casetech&amp;cart=912129006-15758.db&amp;tstamp=912129006&amp;category=4&amp;code=207-JORNADA&amp;subcat=44"><font
size="3" face="Arial">Case Tech</font></a><font face="Arial"> web
site. </font><font size="1" face="Arial">(Thanks to Mark C for
spotting that).</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">2. Another company, this one
called </font><a
href="http://www.ebcases.com/store/scripts/store.exe"><font
size="3" face="Arial">The E&amp;B Company</font></a><font
size="3" face="Arial">, has a &quot;coming soon&quot; case for
the Jornada advertised on their web site. This company makes
leather cases for various PDAs, including the Palm and Nino. You
can even get your own company logo embossed on it. More details
at their web site, or when they send me one! :-)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">3. A good tip is to use a hardback book
cover from Barnes and Nobel. It has a nice carrying strap and
some useful extra pockets.&nbsp; It's manufactured by Book Gear
USA.&nbsp;</font><font size="1" face="Arial"> (Thanks to H. for
the tip)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Don't forget the button!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">That white blob at the top of the case?
Wondered what it does? Press it: it lights up! Amazing... No,
wait, there's more. If your Jornada is playing an alarm, press it
to cancel. No need to open up the case, and so an ideal way to
shut it off if you are using the computer as an alarm clock. </font><font
size="1" face="Arial">(Thanks to H. for the tip)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>More Keyboard shortcuts</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Here are some more &quot;in the know&quot;
key presses to speed up using your Jornada.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and '-' will launch the PC
        Link communications utility</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Alt and Tab will start the Task
        Manager</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Within Pocket Word, hold down Alt,
        type a number (e.g. 4 and 2), release Alt. <br>
        You can enter a huge range of characters in this way.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Alt and Esc will jump to the next open
        Task</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Hold down S during a reset to start
        the self-diagnostic utility.</font></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Creating a desktop wallpaper
pattern</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I've been experimenting with desktop
wallpaper, and my favourite image is displayed below. This is a
full 640 by 480 BMP image, taken from a scanned photograph and
dithered to 256 colours in Photoshop. The strip on the left was
included specifically to give the desktop icons somewhere to sit,
and then colour matched to the background icon text (R:0 B:255
G:255). As you can see, the effect is quite pleasing -- not least
because of my lovely wife on her motorbike! Image shimmering is
present, but only very slightly. As the image has already been
processed down to 256 colours, it's not very large and it doesn't
seem to slow down the Jornada any.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Copying the image across was easy with the
drag-and-drop desktop services. On the Jornada, selecting the
Display Properties meant it was a simple matter to use the new
image as wallpaper.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you have any good backdrops, send them
in so we can all share them! Go </font><a href="jornadaback.htm"><font
face="Arial">here</font></a><font face="Arial"> for some example
images.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><img src="images/sampledesktop.gif"
width="386" height="290"></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Use the Shortcut Keys</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">There are many shortcuts which can be
achieved using the Windows key (there had to be a reason for
it!). Some of the more useful ones are:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows on its own brings up the Start
        menu</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and H brings up Help</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and E starts Windows Explorer</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and C brings up the control
        panel</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and R bring up the RUN dialog</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and I brings up Mouse (<em>I</em>nput)
        Properties</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and K brings up Keyboard
        Properties</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Windows and M minimises all windows
        and returns you to the desktop (very handy)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Remember also these work in all programs
and dialogs:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">Control and C for Copy</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Control and V for Paste</font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial">Control and X for Cut</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial">Finally:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial">ESC will cancel most dialog windows. </font><font
        size="1" face="Arial">(thanks to Joe for the tip)</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>bFind</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">The bFind utility included with
the Jornada can be a very quick way to locate often used files.
Best of all, it can live in the tooltray ready for action. Start
it running (Start/Programs/Accessories) and then select File/Use
Try Icon. This will cause bFind to leave a little icon in the
tooltray,sitting beside the time display. When you next need to
find a file, double-click on the icon and up pops the window.
Select the type of file you want to look for from the list on the
left, click the &quot;Include Subfolders&quot; and then type the
word or phrase you need in the Look for: box. Frequently used
files can be turned into Shortcuts for ease of access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Use a USB Mouse!</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you are using the Jornada at a desk, use
the USB socket to provide your computer with a mouse. The MS
Intellimouse V3.0 USB and Kensington Mouse-in-a-box mouse
(another standard-sized mouse, available from dealers such as
CompUSA) both work very well. Drivers for the mouse are built
into the Jornada's ROM, so it's simply a matter of
plug-in-and-go. One catch is that you cannot use the scroll wheel
on the mouse, only the ordinary left/right buttons.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Touchpad Interfering with Typing</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The touchpad is ultra-senstive, and if you
brush it while typing it can move the cursor and mess up your
document. HP thought of this, and included an option called
&quot;Disable touch pad when typing&quot; in the &quot;HP touch
pad properties&quot;. Select this, and the touchpad is
temporarily stunned for a fraction of a second after you type.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/touch.gif" width="253" height="245"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Multiple Selection</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">My Jornada was driving me nuts because I
couldn't seem to multiple select items in the Inbox program. When
I held down CTRL to select several items, nothing happened.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I found that this didn't happen when using
the USB mouse, and I then realised it was because I had turned on
the setting &quot;Disable touch pad when typing&quot; in the
&quot;HP touch pad properties&quot;. I find this option totally
essential by the way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">To select multiple items with this option
on, and using the touchpad, click on the first item as normal and
then press CTRL. Instead of clicking on the second item, press
the space bar. This seems to free up the pad motion, and you can
now continue to hold down CTRL, move the cursor to the next item
and click to select.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>Moving between open documents</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">If you often have several Word documents
open at once (making it easy to copy and paste information
between them for example) you might find these hints useful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Pressing the Word shortcut key only opens
one instance of Word: so if you are in another window, and want
to get back to Word, press it again. If you want to open a second
document, hold down CTRL as you press the Word shortcut key.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">While multiple Word documents are open,
shuffle between them by pressing the Word shortcut button, or by
using CTRL and &quot;.&quot; and CTRL and &quot;,&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>USB Peripherals</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">So far the only USB peripherals supported
by the Jornada are the MS Intellimouse V3.0 USB and the
Kensington Mouse-in-a-box mouse. Keyboards, cameras, ZIP drives
and so forth are not supported: yet.</font></p>
