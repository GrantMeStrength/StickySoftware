        to find your way around the sky. Unlikea map on a piece
        of paper, the Pocket Universe display is dynamic. It
        shows you what you really see, for any time or location. </strong></font><p><font
        face="Arial">Zoom out until you see the horizon and get
        your bearings. It can take few moments to match the of
        the stars in the sky to the display you see. After all,
        you're trying to reconcile the huge vastness of the
        universe with a small LCD screen a few inches across! </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">To get started, try finding a few
        basic constellations. Those which you can see will depend
        on your location and the time of year. For Northern
        Hemisphere dwellers, Orion, Ursa Major (the &quot;Big
        Dipper&quot; or &quot;Plough&quot;), and Cassiopeia are
        good examples. They are obvious outlines which should
        help you gauge the size of objects in the sky. Remember
        that the two &quot;pointer star&quot; in Ursa Major point
        towards Polaris: a star which is always to the North of
        you. This will help you work out which way you are
        facing. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Once things have clicked into place
        and you have got to grips with the sky and using Pocket
        Universe to look around it, here is a list of some
        objects you might want to look out for. All these objects
        look best through a telescope (even a small one will do)
        or a pair of binoculars, although you can usually see
        something of interest with the naked eye on a good,
        clear, dark night.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">Warning: don't look
        at the Sun through a telescope or binoculars. The heat
        and intensity of the Sun will permanently damage your
        eyes.</font></p>

        <td><h3><font face="Arial">The Moon</font></h3>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The moon is our companion
        in space. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the Moon orbits
        the Earth. By quirk of nature, both the Moon and Sun
        appear to be the same size in the sky: although the Moon
        is very much smaller than the Sun, it's also very much
        closer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial">The best time to look at
        the Moon is not when it's Full. The surface of the Full
        Moon is very bright, but there are no shadows: at other
        phases, the sunlight on the lunar surface casts shadows
        making it easier to see the craters, mountain ranges, and
        &quot;seas&quot;. There are no real seas on the Moon of
        course, but early astronomers imaging that the smooth,
        darker regions on the Moon were oceans, lakes and even
        marshes &#150; hence names such as &quot;The Sea of
        Tranquillity&quot;: the location where mankind first
        explored the lunar surface back in 1969.</font></p>

        <td><h3 align="left"><font face="Arial">The Planets</font></h3>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The planets are the
        worlds which orbit the Sun. The Earth is only one of
        nine, and it's possible to see almost all the others if
        you know where to look. Venus, Jupiter and Saturn are
        particularly bright: appearing brighter than any star at
        times. Looking at them through a telescope, you should
        see clearly that they aren't like stars &#150; rather
        than appearing like a point of light, they look like a
        small disk or crescent. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><em>Jupiter</em> is
        worth looking at for many reasons. First of all, it's the
        largest planet and so even a small telescope will resolve
        its shape. A telescope of 6&quot; or more should clearly
        make patterns on its surface visible: usually two dark
        horizontal bands. These are variations in the planet's
        atmosphere. You should also see four bright dots close
        by: these are the moons of Jupiter, which orbit around
        it. You can use Pocket Universe to predict the location
        of these moons.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><em>Saturn</em> is the
        second largest planet, and although you probably won't
        see any surface detail you will see its beautiful rings.
        You must make a point of buying, begging or borrowing a
        telescope to see these!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><em>Venus</em> is the
        planet closest to us, and often appears as a bright star
        in the evening or morning. As it's surface is shrouded
        with clouds you won't see any detail: but you will see
        prominent phases. Venus will vary from a full disk to a
        thin crescent.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><em>Mars</em> is the
        &quot;Red Planet&quot;, and it will appear this way in
        even a small telescope. With higher magnifications you
        should be able to detect the ice at the polar caps, and
        even some dark smudges on the surface. Mars suffers from
        huge periodic sand storms, so it's worth observing it
        from week to week.</font></p>

        <td><h3><font face="Arial">Stars</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial">No matter how powerful your
        telescope, stars always appear as points of light. They
        are just so far away that it is impossible to see any
        detail. However, that doesn't make them uninteresting: on
        the contrary, there are lots of stars worth your
        attention. Here are some worth looking out for. Their
        locations are provided as approximate Right Ascension and
        Declination values, so you can use Pocket Universe to
        find them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Albireo is a star in the
        constellation Cygnus the Swan. It's interesting because
        it's actually a double star, one blue-green, the other
        yellow. The stars' proximity makes the colour contrast
        very obvious. RA: 19:29, Dec: 27:52) Other
        double/multiple stars include Mizar (RA: 12:54, Dec:
        56:01) and Betelgeuse ( RA: 5:55, Dec: 7:23).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">As you would expect there are
        thousands of other &quot;interesting&quot; stars,
        including variables which change their brightness
        periodically. Some variable stars change because they are
        eclipsed by fainter stars, others actually change
        brightness due to internal processes. Some stars which
        change in this way are located at RA: 00:38, Dec: 56:16.
        RA: 00:54, Dec: 60:27, RA: 01:06, Dec:-55:31, and RA:
        02:17, Dec:-03:12.</font></p>

        <td><h3><font face="Arial">Galaxies and Nebulae</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial">Galaxies are huge collections of
        stars,. Our own sun is in a Galaxy too, which we call
        &quot;The Milky Way&quot;. All the stars you can see with
        your naked eye are part of the Milky Way. On dark nights
        you can see the Milky Way appear as a fuzzy band of light
        crossing the entire sky: we see the band of light was we
        are looking edge-on into our own galaxy. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Looking for examples is easy: you
        don't need a telescope to see the brightest. The
        Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is a galaxy of a similar shape to
        our own, however it is over 2,200,000 light years away
        from us. That means when you look at it, the light you
        see has been travelling through space for over two
        million years. With the naked eye, you should be able to
        see a faint fuzzy patch: through binoculars or a
        telescope you should be able to see a shape with slightly
        more structure to it. Use the Goto Messier menu option,
        and enter M31 to find it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Other Galaxies worth looking for
        include: M81 and M82 in Ursa Major, M104 in Virgo known
        as the &quot;Sombrero Hat&quot;, M51known as the
        &quot;Whirlpool&quot; and M64 known as the &quot;Black
        Eye&quot;. Please note that Galaxies by their nature are
        a long way away, and the light from them is faint. You
        may have seen spectacular photographs on them in books,
        but these have been taking using time exposures which can
        capture a lot of light. Even though large telescopes,
        Galaxies tend to look like fuzzy shapes: so don't be
        disappointed. Just think: when you look at M64 for
        example, the light started on its journey to your eye
        over 20 million years ago.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">A <strong>Nebula</strong> is a vast
        cloud of dust or gas in a galaxy. There are many
        different kinds: some emit their own light, some absorb
        it and some reflect it. They can appear as coloured
        clouds, or black bands or even beautiful rings
        surrounding stars. Perhaps the most famous Nebula is the
        Orion Nebula (M42), which looks like a fuzzy glow under
        the &quot;belt&quot; of three stars. </font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><h3><font face="Arial">Clusters</font></h3>
        <p><font face="Arial">A group of stars held together by
        their mutual gravitational attraction is a cluster. They
        can appear as fuzzy patches, although they are actually
        composed of individual stars. Perhaps the most famous is
        the Pleiades, or Seven Sisters. This is a wonderful
        grouping of bright stars in the constellation of Taurus,
        also known as M45. You should have no trouble finding it,
        and it makes a wonderful site through binoculars.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The M13 cluster in Hercules and M44
        Praesepe (Beehive) cluster are also bright enough to see
        with the naked eye, and if you are lucky you should be
        able to see the M11 &quot;Wild Duck&quot; cluster too.</font></p>
