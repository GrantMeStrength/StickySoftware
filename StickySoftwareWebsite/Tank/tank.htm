you a present: the full, new and improved version of TankZone.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">You can download and play the full
version for as long as you like, and you won't<br>
have to pay us a penny, cent or whatever the smallest unit of
your local currency.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In return we ask only two things: </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">1. You make a small donation to a
local charity of your choice. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">2. You do not store the program on
a Web site or provide a link to<br>
the ZIP files. Instead you must point to www.sticky.net. For this<br>
reason the ZIP files are randomly renamed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Please note: TankZone is
NOT&nbsp;free. You MUST&nbsp;make a charitable<br>
contribution to play it. If you don't, you will soon find a
strange pimple<br>
growing on your nose. This pimple will get larger and larger
until it<br>
becomes the size (and shape) of a wheel barrow. This is
SCIENTIFIC<br>
FACT and if you don't believe it, too bad.</font></p>

        you download the right version for MIPS and SH3, and<br>
        also -- and this is the key -- download the MFCWCE.DLL
        file. WinCEv1 programs<br>

        anymore!</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Maybe you have run out
        of ammunition. Look at the display to<br>
        see if &quot;Ammo&quot; is zero. If it is, you better
        find one of the supply depots,<br>
        which show up as little flags. Drive up to it, and your
        ammo supply<br>
        will be replenished.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q. It's too hard!</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Keep trying. Use the

        the enemy tanks and saucers are located, where the supply
        depots are<br>
        and who is firing at you. Remember to switch off the

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. My screen flickers!</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Some HPCs are a little

        this reason we have included a speed control (under
        Options menu),<br>
        and also the ability to switch off the landscape and
        ground shading<br>
        effects. Please experiment with these settings. It's also
        a very good<br>

        run TankZone?</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. An HPC, with WindowsCE.
        This program was written on a Velo1, <br>
        under WindowsCEv1. The program should run under WindowsCE
        v2, <br>
        but wehaven't been able to test this. Obviously we're as
        keen as everyone <br>
        else to get hold of WinCEv2. If you have a WinCEv2
        machine, then <br>
        installing the original MFCWCE.DLL file might mean the
        program will work.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. What is this
        MFCWCE.DLL&nbsp;stuff?</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. When programming the
        WindowsCE platform, the programmer can choose <br>
        to make use of some predefined Microsoft libraries which
        make it relatively <br>
        easy to add menus, buttons, timers, and so on. These are
        the MFC.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To run a program written
        using these functions, you need a MFC library file, <br>
        called a &quot;DLL&quot; or &quot;Dynamic Link
        Library&quot;. On some HPCs this file is not present <br>
        in the ROM and so needs to be copied over. The file is
        called &quot;MFCWCE.DLL&quot; <br>
        and is placed in the Windows directory.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The nature of DLLs means
        that only one copy is needed no matter how many <br>
        programs use it. Without it, a program will load but
        crash out with an error <br>
        message at once.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. There is a large
        blank portion of screen!</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. There should be, if
        your HPC&nbsp;has more than 480 pixels across. Our HPC<br>
        has 480, and so we cannot test software which has a
        larger screen.We might<br>
        develop and Wide Screen version.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. I get an error
        message when I try to run it!</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. If you get an error
        message when you try to run the program, this is most
        likely <br>
        due to you not having the MFC library file stored on your
        HPC. This is a file <br>
        containing common functions, and is required by
        applications written in a particular <br>
        way. You may already have this library depending on your
        HPC (the HP device has <br>
        it in ROM) or if have already installed a program which
        includes the library. If you <br>
        don&#146;t have these files, you will have to download
        them. Make sure you download the <br>
        right version of the MFC libraries for your computer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. I can't hear any
        sounds!</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A. Some HPCs have a sound
        compression built-in, and this means that the sound<br>
        effect WAV files can be stored in a very small amount of
        memory. However, not<br>
        all HPCs have this library and need standard PCM WAV
        files. If you have installed<br>
        the compressed sound effects and your system doesn't
        support them, you won't<br>
        hear anything. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Q. I still can't hear anything!<br>
        <br>
        </b>A. If the sound effects are not in a directory called
        TankZone/ in the root directory,<br>
        that is, in the same level as Windows and Control Panel,
        then the program won't<br>
        find them and won't be able to play them. You can check
        to see if the samples<br>
        themselves are working by double-clicking them. If you
        can hear them, then either<br>
        they are stored in the wrong location or the Sound option
        in the TankZone game<br>
        has been turned off.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Q. Can I do without sounds to save memory?<br>
        <br>
        </b>A. Yes. Turn off the sound option and delete the WAV
        files.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Q. Can I&nbsp;run this
        program on a memory card? Can I store it elsewhere on my
        HPC?<br>
        <br>
        </b>A. No. It must be in a directory called TankZone, in
        the root. Look, it's not<br>
        costing you anything, is it? If you had payed twenty
        bucks it would be a<br>
        different matter. It's only a game. Enjoy it and don't
        hassle me -- it's<br>

        <b>Q. I&nbsp;registered the evaluation version! Do I get
