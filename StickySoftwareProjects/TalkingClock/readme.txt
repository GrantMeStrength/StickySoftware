Speaking Clock


This program and data is copyright Sticky Software.

Please note: two versions of the application
will be copied to your handheld. The version
entitled "talkcf" is designed to work with 
sound samples located in CF memory. If you
have CF memory, use the desktop explorer to
move the entire folder called "clock" from 
Windows/ to the root of the CF card. 
Then use "talkcf" instead of "talk". 

You can use the desktop explorer to remove 
the version you don't need.

For best results, assign one of the user
definable buttons to launch the program.
