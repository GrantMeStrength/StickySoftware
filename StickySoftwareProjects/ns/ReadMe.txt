The NStall Wizard is a Windows® "Wizard"-style application that leads you through the steps necessary to create your product installation. Simply fill in a few details, and let the Wizard do the rest!

The Wizard provides you with a fast and easy method to give your product installations a professional look. A typical installation can be created in as little as 5 minutes - without writing a single line of code!


What Your Users Will See 

When your users install your product, they will be impressed by the professional appearance of your installation. After the user agrees to your License Agreement (Yes, you can specify your own License Agreement to be displayed!), the installation program will detect which version of Windows® CE is installed on the desktop computer, and begin the proper installation procedure.

If they are running Version 1.0, your application will be installed directly onto the H/PC using Microsoft's "ppcload.dll", approved for use with CE 1.0. And if they are running Version 2.0, your application will be registered with the Application Manager for installation. Both with a single installation package!

Next, if your application uses "File Filter DLLs" to convert files from H/PC format to desktop computer format (or vice versa), these "Filters" can be installed automatically as well! The DLLs will be copied to a user-specified folder on the desktop computer, and registered with the H/PC Explorer(CE 1.0) or Mobile Devices(CE 2.0) for you!
