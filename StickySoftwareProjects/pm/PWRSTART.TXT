PartitionMagic does not run under Windows NT.  You must boot DOS 
(or Windows 95's MS-DOS Mode), before running PartitionMagic.  We regret the
inconvenience this may cause, but PartitionMagic is a new breed of disk
utility that makes changes to partitions beyond what operating system
designers thought possible.  We're seeking Microsoft's cooperation in
eliminating limitations such as this.

To run PartitionMagic from DOS, change to the directory where you installed
PartitionMagic (typically, C:\PQMAGIC) and type

  PQMAGIC
