       WIN32 APPLICATION : EmptyPro
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this EmptyPro application for you.  

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your EmptyPro application.

EmptyPro.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

EmptyPro.h
    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other
    project specific headers (including Resource.h).

EmptyPro.dsp
    This file (the project file) contains information at the project level and
    is used to build a single project or subproject. Other users can share the
    project (.dsp) file, but they should export the makefiles locally.
	

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
AppWizard has created the following resources:

EmptyPro.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Visual C++.

EmptyPro.ico
    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon (32x32).
    This icon is included by the main resource file EmptyPro.rc.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named EmptyPro.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
